\title{PC Score Correlation Test}
\usage{
PCScoreCorrelation(
  means,
  cov.matrix,
  taxons = names(means),
  show.plots = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{means}{list or array of species means being compared. array must have means in the rows.}

\item{cov.matrix}{ancestral covariance matrix for all populations}

\item{taxons}{names of taxons being compared. Must be in the same order of the means.}

\item{show.plots}{boolean. If TRUE, plot of eigenvalues of ancetral matrix by between group variance is showed.}
}
\value{
list of results containing:

correlation matrix of principal component scores and p.values for each correlation. Lower triangle of outputput are correlations, and upper triangle are p.values.

if show.plots is TRUE, also returns a list of plots of all projections of the nth PCs, where n is the number of taxons.
}
\description{
Given a set of covariance matrices and means for terminals, test the hypothesis
that obseved divergency is larger/smaller than expected by drift alone using the correlation on
principal component scores.
}
\examples{
#Input can be an array with means in each row or a list of mean vectors
means = array(rnorm(40*10), c(10, 40)) 
cov.matrix = RandomMatrix(40, 1, 1, 10)
taxons = LETTERS[1:10]
PCScoreCorrelation(means, cov.matrix, taxons)

\dontrun{
##Plots list can be displayed using plot_grid()
library(cowplot)
pc.score.output <- PCScoreCorrelation(means, cov.matrix, taxons, TRUE)
plot_grid(plotlist = pc.score.output$plots)
}
