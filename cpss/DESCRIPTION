Description: Implements multiple change searching algorithms for a variety of 
    frequently considered parametric change-point models. In particular, it 
    integrates a criterion proposed by Zou, Wang and Li (2020) 
    <doi:10.1214/19-AOS1814> to select the number of change-points in a 
    data-driven fashion. Moreover, it also provides interfaces for 
    users-customized change-point models with their own cost function and 
    estimation routines.
