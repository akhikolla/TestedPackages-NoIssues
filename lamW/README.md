# lamW

**lamW** is an `R` package which calculates the real-valued branches of the
[Lambert-W function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function) without
the need to install the entire GSL. It uses compiled code and 
[`RcppParallel`](https://rcppcore.github.io/RcppParallel/) to achieve
significant speed.
