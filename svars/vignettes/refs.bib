They interpret the first as supply disturbances, the second as demand disturbances. Demand disturbances have a hump-shaped, mirror-image effect on output and unemployment. The effect of supply disturbances on output increases steadily over time, peaking after two years and reaching a plateau after five years. Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.},

  abstract = {We study the effects of U.S. monetary policy shocks on the bilateral exchange rate between the U.S. and each of the G7 countries. We also estimate deviations from uncovered interest rate parity conditional on these shocks. The analysis is based on a structural vector autoregression in which monetary policy shocks are identified through the conditional heteroscedasticity of the structural disturbances. Unlike earlier work in this area, our empirical methodology avoids making arbitrary assumptions about the relevant policy indicator or transmission mechanism in order to achieve identification. At the same time, it allows us to assess the implications of imposing invalid identifying restrictions. Our results indicate that the nominal exchange rate exhibits delayed overshooting in response to a monetary expansion, depreciating for roughly ten months before starting to appreciate. The shock also leads to large and persistent departures from uncovered interest rate parity. Variance-decomposition results indicate that monetary policy shocks account for a non-trivial proportion of exchange rate fluctuations.},

  abstract = {The well-known problem of non-identifiability of structural VAR models disappears if the structural shocks are independent and if at most one of them is Gaussian. In that case, the relevant estimation technique is the Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Since the introduction of ICA by Comon (1994), various semi-parametric estimation methods have been proposed for “orthogonalizing” the error terms. These methods include pseudo maximum likelihood (PML) approaches and recursive PML. The aim of our paper is to derive the asymptotic properties of the PML approaches, in particular to study their consistency. We conduct Monte Carlo studies exploring the relative performances of these methods. Finally, an application based on real data shows that structural VAR models can be estimated without additional identification restrictions in the non-Gaussian case and that the usual restrictions can be tested.},

Unfortunately, these shocks may not have a meaningful structural economic interpretation. It is discussed how statistical and conventional identifying information can be combined. The discussion is based on a VAR model for the US containing oil prices, output, consumer prices and a short-term interest rate. The system has been used for studying the causes of the early millennium economic slowdown based on traditional identification with zero and long-run restrictions and using sign restrictions. We find that previously drawn conclusions are questionable in our framework.},

  Abstract                 = {Time series econometrics is a rapidly evolving field. Particularly, the cointegration revolution has had a substantial impact on applied analysis. Hence, no textbook has managed to cover the full range of methods in current use and explain how to proceed in applied domains. This gap in the literature motivates the present volume. The methods are sketched out, reminding the reader of the ideas underlying them and giving sufficient background for empirical work. The treatment can also be used as a textbook for a course on applied time series econometrics. Topics include: unit root and cointegration analysis, structural vector autoregressions, conditional heteroskedasticity and nonlinear and nonparametric time series models. Crucial to empirical work is the software that is available for analysis. New methodology is typically only gradually incorporated into existing software packages. Therefore a flexible Java interface has been created, allowing readers to replicate the applications and conduct their own analyses.},

Monte Carlo simulations for a wide range of bivariate models show that in small samples bias-corrected bootstrap intervals tend to be more accurate than delta method intervals, standard bootstrap intervals, and Monte Carlo integration intervals. This conclusion holds for VAR models estimated in levels, as deviations from a linear time trend, and in first differences. It also holds for random walk processes and cointegrated processes estimated in levels. An empirical example shows that bias-corrected bootstrap intervals may imply economic interpretations of the data that are substantively different from standard methods. },

Although it can be difficult to find the true volatility model with the selection criteria, using them is recommended because they can reduce the mean squared error of impulse response estimates substantially relative to a model that is chosen arbitrarily based on the personal preferences of a researcher. Heteroscedasticity tests are found to be useful tools for deciding whether time-varying volatility is present but do not discriminate well between different types of volatility changes. The selection methods are illustrated by specifying a model for the global market for crude oil.},

  abstract = {Several recently developed identification techniques for structural VAR models are based on the assumption of non-Gaussianity. So-called independence based identification provides unique structural shocks (up to scaling and ordering) under the assumption of at most one Gaussian component. While non-Gaussianity of certain interesting shocks appears rather natural, not all macroeconomic shocks in the system might show this clear difference from Gaussianity. Identifiability can be generalized by noting that even in the presence of multiple Gaussian shocks the non-Gaussian ones are still unique. Consequently, independence based identification allows to uniquely determine the (non-Gaussian) shocks of interest irrespective of the distribution of the remaining system. Furthermore, studying settings close to normality or with multiple Gaussian components highlights the performance of normality diagnostics and their applicability to decide on the identifiability of the structural shock components. In an illustrative five dimensional model the identified monetary policy and stock price shock confirm the results of previous studies on the monetary policy asset price nexus.},

The bootstrap methods considered are a wild bootstrap, a moving blocks bootstrap and a GARCH residual based bootstrap. Estimation is done by Gaussian maximum likelihood, a simplified procedure based on univariate GARCH estimations and a method that does not re-estimate the GARCH parameters in each bootstrap replication. The latter method is computationally more efficient than the other methods and it is competitive with the other methods and often leads to the smallest confidence sets without sacrificing coverage precision. An empirical model for assessing monetary policy in the U.S. is considered as an example. It is found that the different inference methods for impulse responses lead to qualitatively very similar results.},

  abstract = {Estimating the response of asset prices to changes in monetary policy is complicated by the endogeneity of policy decisions and the fact that both interest rates and asset prices react to numerous other variables. This paper develops a new estimator that is based on the heteroskedasticity that exists in high frequency data. We show that the response of asset prices to changes in monetary policy can be identified based on the increase in the variance of policy shocks that occurs on days of FOMC meetings and of the Chairman's semi-annual monetary policy testimony to Congress. The identification approach employed requires a much weaker set of assumptions than needed under the 'event-study' approach that is typically used in this context. The results indicate that an increase in short-term interest rates results in a decline in stock prices and in an upward shift in the yield curve that becomes smaller at longer maturities. The findings also suggest that the event-study estimates contain biases that make the estimated effects on stock prices appear too small and those on Treasury yields too large.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>},
