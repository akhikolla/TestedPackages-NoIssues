make_basis_list(X_sub, cols)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_sub}{A subset of the columns of X, the original design matrix.}

\item{cols}{An index of the columns that were reduced to by sub-setting.}
}
\description{
Build a sorted list of unique basis functions based on columns, where each

equals cols.length() and each basis function is a list(cols, cutoffs).
