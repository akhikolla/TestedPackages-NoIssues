\title{Probability Plotting Method for Univariate Lifetime Distributions}
\usage{
plot_prob(x, y, event, id = rep("XXXXXX", length(x)),
  distribution = c("weibull", "lognormal", "loglogistic", "normal",
  "logistic", "sev"), title_main = "Probability Plot",
  title_x = "Characteristic", title_y = "Unreliability",
  title_trace = "Sample")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector which consists of lifetime data. Lifetime
data could be every characteristic influencing the reliability of a product,
e.g. operating time (days/months in service), mileage (km, miles), load
cycles.}

\item{y}{a numeric vector which consists of estimated failure probabilities
regarding the lifetime data in \code{x}.}

\item{event}{a vector of binary data (0 or 1) indicating whether unit \emph{i}
is a right censored observation (= 0) or a failure (= 1).}

\item{id}{a character vector for the identification of every unit.}

\item{distribution}{supposed distribution of the random variable. The
value can be \code{"weibull"}, \code{"lognormal"}, \code{"loglogistic"},
\code{"normal"}, \code{"logistic"} or \code{"sev"} \emph{(smallest extreme value)}.
Other distributions have not been implemented yet.}

\item{title_main}{a character string which is assigned to the main title
of the plot.}

\item{title_x}{a character string which is assigned to the title of the
x axis.}

\item{title_y}{a character string which is assigned to the title of the
y axis.}

\item{title_trace}{a character string whis is assigned to the trace shown in
the legend.}
}
\value{
Returns a plotly object containing the layout of the probability plot
  provided by \code{\link{plot_layout}} and the plotting positions.
}
\description{
This function is used to apply the graphical technique of probability
plotting.
}
\details{
The marker label for x is determined by the first word provided in the
argument \code{title_x}, i.e. if \code{title_x = "Mileage in km"} the x label
of the marker is "Mileage".

The marker label for y is determined by the string provided in the
argument \code{title_y}, i.e. if \code{title_y = "Probability in percent"} the y
label of the marker is "Probability".
