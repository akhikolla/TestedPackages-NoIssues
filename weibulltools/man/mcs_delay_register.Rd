\title{Adjustment of Operating Times by Delays in Registration using a Monte Carlo
Approach}
\usage{
mcs_delay_register(date_prod, date_register, x, event,
  distribution = "lognormal", seed = NULL, details = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{date_prod}{a vector of class \code{"character"} or \code{"Date"}, in the
format "yyyy-mm-dd", indicating the date of production of a unit.
If no date is available use \code{NA}.}

\item{date_register}{a vector of class \code{"character"} or \code{"Date"}, in
the format "yyyy-mm-dd", indicating the date of registration of a unit.
If no date is available use \code{NA}.}

\item{x}{a numeric vector of operating times.}

\item{event}{a vector of binary data (0 or 1) indicating whether unit \emph{i}
is a right censored observation (= 0) or a failure (= 1).}

\item{distribution}{supposed distribution of the random variable. The default
value is \code{"lognormal"}. So far no other distribution is implemented.}

\item{seed}{if \code{seed = NULL} a random seed is used. Otherwise the user
can specify an integer for the seed.}

\item{details}{a logical variable, where the default value is \code{FALSE}.
If \code{FALSE} the output consists of a vector with corrected operating
times for the censored units and the input operating times for the
failed units. If \code{TRUE} the output consists of a detailed list, i.e
the same vector as described before, simulated random numbers, estimated
distribution parameters and a seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of corrected operating times for the censored units
  and the input operating times for the failed units if
  \code{details = FALSE}. If \code{details = TRUE} the output is a list which
  consists of the following elements:
  \itemize{
  \item \code{time} : Numeric vector of corrected operating times for the
    censored observations and input operating times for failed units.
  \item \code{x_sim} : Simulated random numbers of specified distribution with
    estimated parameters. The length of \code{x_sim} is equal to the number of
    censored observations.
  \item \code{coefficients} : Estimated coefficients of supposed
    distribution.
  \item \code{int_seed} : Integer seed number for reproducibility.}
}
\description{
In general the amount of information about units in the field, that have not
failed yet, are rare. For example it is common that a supplier, who provides
parts to the automotive industry does not know when a vehicle was put in
service and therefore does not know the exact operating time of the supplied
parts. This function uses a Monte Carlo approach for simulating the operating
times of (multiple) right censored observations, taking account of registering
delays. The simulation is based on the distribution of operating times that were
calculated from complete data (see \code{\link{dist_delay_register}}).
