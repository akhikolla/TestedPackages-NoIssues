\title{Mixture Model Identification using Segmented Regression}
\usage{
mixmod_regression(x, y, event, distribution = c("weibull", "lognormal",
  "loglogistic"), conf_level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector which consists of lifetime data. Lifetime
data could be every characteristic influencing the reliability of a
product, e.g. operating time (days/months in service), mileage (km,
miles), load cycles.}

\item{y}{a numeric vector which consists of estimated failure
probabilities regarding the lifetime data in \code{x}.}

\item{event}{a vector of binary data (0 or 1) indicating whether
unit \emph{i} is a right censored observation (= 0) or a
failure (= 1).}

\item{distribution}{supposed distribution of the random variable. The
value can be \code{"weibull"}, \code{"lognormal"} or \code{"loglogistic"}.
Other distributions have not been implemented yet.}

\item{conf_level}{confidence level of the interval. The default value is
\code{conf_level = 0.95}.}
}
\value{
Returns a list where the length of the list depends on
  the number of identified subgroups. Each list has the same
  information as provided by \link{rank_regression}. Additionally each list
  has an element that specifies the range regarding the lifetime data for
  every subgroup.
}
\description{
This method uses piecewise linear regression to separate the data in
subgroups, if appropriate. Since this happens in an automated fashion
the function tends to overestimate the number of breakpoints and
therefore returns too many subgroups. This problem is already stated in
the documentation of the function \link{segmented.lm}, which is part of
the \emph{segmented} package. A maximum of three subgroups can be obtained.
