\title{Estimation of Driving Distances for Censored Observations using a Monte Carlo
Approach}
\usage{
mcs_mileage(x, event, mileage, distribution = "lognormal", seed = NULL,
  details = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector of operating times. If not available use \code{NA}.}

\item{event}{a vector of binary data (0 or 1) indicating whether unit \emph{i}
is a right censored observation (= 0) or a failure (= 1).}

\item{mileage}{a numeric vector of driven distances. If not available use \code{NA}.}

\item{distribution}{supposed distribution of the random variable. The default
value is \code{"lognormal"}. So far no other distribution is implemented.}

\item{seed}{if \code{seed = NULL} a random seed is used. Otherwise the user
can specify an integer for the seed.}

\item{details}{a logical variable, where the default value is \code{FALSE}.
If \code{FALSE} the output consists of a vector with simulated driving
distances for the censored units regarding to their current operating time
and the input driving distances for the failed units. If \code{TRUE} the
output consists of a detailed list, i.e the same vector as described before,
simulated annual driving distances, estimated distribution parameters and a
seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A numerical vector of simulated driving distances for the censored
  units and the input driving distances for the failed units if
  \code{details = FALSE}. If \code{details = TRUE} the output is a list which
  consists of the following elements:
  \itemize{
  \item \code{mileage} : Simulated driving distances for the censored
    units and the input driving distances for the failed units.
  \item \code{mileage_sim_annual} : Simulated annual driving distances of
    specified distribution with estimated parameters. The length of
    \code{x_sim} is equal to the number of censored observations.
  \item \code{coefficients} : Estimated coefficients of supposed
    distribution.
  \item \code{int_seed} : Integer seed number for reproducibility.}
}
\description{
This function simulates driving distances for censored observations under the
condition that the operating time of these items is known up to a certain date
where analysis is made. Operating times for these units can be estimated with
functions like \code{\link{mcs_delay_register}}, \code{\link{mcs_delay_report}}
and \code{\link{mcs_delays}}.
The failed observations (where the driving distances are known) are used to
estimate an annual mileage distribution. If the mileage distribution is fully
specified annual random driving distances are drawn from this distribution and
afterwards adjusted to the operating times of the censored observations.
