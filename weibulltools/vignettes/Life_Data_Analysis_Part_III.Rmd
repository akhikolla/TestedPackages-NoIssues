In this vignette two methods for the separation of mixture models are presented. 
A mixture model can be assumed, if the points in a probability plot show one or 
more changes in slope, depict one or several saddle points or follow an 
S-shape. A mixed distribution often represents the combination of multiple failure 
modes and thus must be splitted in its components to get reasonable results in 
further analyses. 

Segmented regression aims to detect breakpoints in the sample data from whom a 
split in subgroups can be made. The EM-Algorithm is a computation-intensive method 
that iteratively tries to maximize a likelihood function, which is weighted by 
the posterior probability, the conditional probability that an observation belongs 
to subgroup _k_.  

In the following we will focus on the application of these methods and their 
visualizations using functions `mixmod_regression()`, `mixmod_em()`, 
`plot_prob_mix()` and `plot_mod_mix()`, which are implemented in `weibulltools`. 

## Data: Voltage Stress Test

To apply the introduced methods we will use a dataset where units were passed 
to a high voltage stress test. _hours_ indicates the number of hours until a failure 
occurs, or the number of hours until a unit was taken out of the test and has 
not failed. _state_ is a flag variable and describes the condition of a unit. 
If a unit failed the flag is 1 and 0 otherwise. Data was taken from 
_Reliability Analysis by Failure Mode_ [^note1].

## Probability Plot for Voltage Stress Test Data

To get an intuition whether we can assume the presence of a mixture model, we will 
construct a Weibull probability plot. 

```{r probability plot weibull, fig.cap = "Figure 1: Plotting positions in weibull grid.", message = FALSE}
# Data: 
hours <- c(2, 28, 67, 119, 179, 236, 282, 317, 348, 387, 3, 31, 69, 135,
           191, 241, 284, 318, 348, 392, 5, 31, 76, 144, 203, 257, 286,
           320, 350, 412, 8, 52, 78, 157, 211, 261, 298, 327, 360, 446,
           13, 53, 104, 160, 221, 264, 303, 328, 369, 21, 64, 113, 168,
           226, 278, 314, 328, 377)

state <- c(1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1,
           1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0,
           1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
           0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

id <- 1:length(hours)

# Estimating failure probabilities: 
df_john <- johnson_method(id = id, x = hours, event = state)

# Probability plot: 
weibull_plot <- plot_prob(x = df_john$characteristic, y = df_john$prob, 
                          event = df_john$status, id = df_john$id, 
                          distribution = "weibull", 
                          title_main = "Weibull Probability Plot", 
                          title_x = "Time in Hours", 
                          title_y = "Probability of Failure in %",
                          title_trace = "Defect Items")
weibull_plot
```

<br>
Since there is an obvious slope change in the Weibull probability plot of _Figure 1_, 
the appearance of a mixture model is strengthened.  

## Segmented Regression with Package `weibulltools`

In package `weibulltools` the method of segmented regression is implemented in 
function `mixmod_regression()`. If a breakpoint was detected, the failure data is 
separated by that point. After breakpoint detection the function `rank_regression()` 
is called inside `mixmod_regression()` and is used to estimate the distribution 
parameters of the subgroups.  
The visualization of the obtained results is done by functions `plot_prob_mix()` 
and `plot_mod_mix()`.  
The produced graph of `plot_prob_mix()` is pretty similar to the graph provided 
by `plot_prob()`, but the difference is, that the detected subgroups are colored 
differently.  
`plot_mod_mix()` then is used to add the estimated regression line of every sub-
distribution.  
In the following the described procedure is expressed with code.  

```{r segmented weibull I, fig.cap = "Figure 2: Subgroup-specific plotting positions.", message = FALSE}
# Applying mixmod_regression(): 
mixreg_weib <- mixmod_regression(x = df_john$characteristic, y = df_john$prob, 
  event = df_john$status, distribution = "weibull")

# Using plot_prob_mix(). 
mix_reg_plot <- plot_prob_mix(x = hours, event = state, id = id, 
  distribution = "weibull", mix_output = mixreg_weib, 
  title_main = "Weibull Mixture Regression", title_x = "Time in Hours", 
  title_y = "Probability of Failure", title_trace = "Subgroup")
mix_reg_plot
```

```{r segmented weibull II, fig.cap = "Figure 3: Subgroup-specific regression lines.", message = FALSE}
# Using plot_mod_mix() to visualize regression lines of subgroups: 
mix_reg_lines <- plot_mod_mix(mix_reg_plot, x = hours, event = state, 
  mix_output = mixreg_weib, distribution = "weibull", title_trace = "Fitted Line")
mix_reg_lines
```

<br>
Without specifying the number of mixed components _(k)_ this method has splitted 
the data in two groups. This can bee seen in _Figure 2_ and _Figure 3_.  
To sum up, an upside of this function is that one does not have to specify the number of 
mixing components, since segmentation happens in an automated fashion. Nevertheless 
the intention of this function is to give a hint for the existence of a mixture 
model. An in-depth analysis should be done afterwards.  

## EM-Algorithm with Package `weibulltools`

The EM-Algorithm can be applied through the usage of the function `mixmod_em()`. 
In comparison to `mixmod_regression()` one has to specify _k_, the number of 
subgroups.  
The obtained results can be visualized by functions `plot_prob_mix()` and 
`plot_mod_mix()`, too.  


```{r em weibull I, fig.cap = "Figure 4: Subgroup-specific plotting positions.", message = FALSE}
# Applying mixmod_regression(): 
mixem_weib <- mixmod_em(x = hours, event = state, distribution = "weibull",
                        conf_level = 0.95, k = 2, method = "EM", n_iter = 150)

# Using plot_prob_mix(): 
mix_em_plot <- plot_prob_mix(x = hours, event = state, id = id, 
  distribution = "weibull", mix_output = mixem_weib, 
  title_main = "Weibull Mixture EM", title_x = "Time in Hours", 
  title_y = "Probability of Failure", title_trace = "Subgroup")
mix_em_plot
```

```{r em weibull II, fig.cap = "Figure 5: Subgroup-specific regression lines.", message = FALSE}

# Using plot_mod_mix() to visualize regression lines of subgroups: 
mix_em_lines <- plot_mod_mix(mix_em_plot, x = hours, event = state, 
  mix_output = mixem_weib, distribution = "weibull", title_trace = "Fitted Line")
mix_em_lines
```

<br>
In comparison to `mixmod_regression()` the EM-Algorithm can also assign censored 
items to a specific subgroup. Hence, an individual analysis of the mixing components, 
depicted in _Figure 4_ and _Figure 5_, is possible.  
In conclusion an analysis of a mixture model using `mixmod_em()` is statistically 
founded. A drawback of this function is, that the identification of the number 
of subgroups can not be determined automatically.
