}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Data.frame of growing season dividing info}

\item{rtrough_max}{\code{ytrough <= rtrough_max*A}, A is the amplitude of y.}

\item{r_min}{Threshold is defined as the difference of peak value with
trough value. There are two threshold (left and right). The minimum threshold
should be greater than r_min.}

\item{dt}{data.table of growing season dividing info}

\item{len_min}{the minimum and maximum length (in the unit of days)
of growing season}

\item{len_max}{the minimum and maximum length (in the unit of days)
of growing season}

\item{lst_dt}{list of \code{dt}. Every year is corresponding to a \code{dt}.}
