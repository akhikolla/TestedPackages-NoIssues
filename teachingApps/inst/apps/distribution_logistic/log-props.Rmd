<h3>About the Logistic Distribution</h3>

- No shape parameter

- PDF shifts to the left as $\mu$ decreases

- PDF shifts to the right as $\mu$ increases

- The location parameter is the mean, $\mu$

- The CDF is the logistic function

- It starts at negative infinity

- Similar in shape to the normal distribution, but with heavier tails
