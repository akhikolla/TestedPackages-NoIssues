### Ok, Tell Me If You've Heard This One Before...

- Four distributions walk into a bar

    + <purple>An exponential</purple>

    + <green>A normal</green>

    + <red>A lognormal</red>

    + <blue>A Weibull</blue>

- Once inside, they observe $`r obs[1]`$ and $`r obs[2]`$ laying on the floor

    + The <purple>exponential</purple> says: 'Those are mine, they came from an exponential distribution'

    + The <green>normal</green> says: 'Those are mine, they came from a normal distribution'

    + The <red>lognormal</red> says: 'Those are mine, they came from a lognormal distribution'

    + The <blue>Weibull</blue> says: 'Those are mine, they came from a Weibull distribution'

- What steps are required to show which distribution is correct?

    + Determine which member of the <purple>Exponential</purple> distribution family best fits the data

    + Determine which member of the <green>Normal</green> distribution family best fits the data

    + Determine which member of the <red>Lognormal</red> distribution family best fits the data

    + Determine which member of the <blue>Weibull</blue> distribution family best fits the data

    + Determine which of these best-fit distributions best fits the data   

- We could perform each of these steps analytically, but...

    + That would be painful and time-consuming

    + It would be of little benefit, since few real problems can be solved analytically 

    + <focus>I really don't want to</focus>

    + For the <purple>exponential</purple> distribution we'll find the MLE's  analytically, graphically and numerically 

    + For the <green>normal</green>, <red>lognormal</red>, and <blue>Weibull</blue> we'll just find them numerically 

### The <purple>Exponential</purple> distribution

<ul>

<li>The <purple>Exponential</purple> distribution has a single parameter $\theta$ and the pdf expressed as

$$
f(t|\theta)=\frac{1}{\theta}\exp\left[-\frac{t}{\theta}\right]
$$
</li>

<li>The joint probability/likelihood of observing $(`r obs`)$ (assuming the <purple>exponential</purple> distribution is correct) would be expressed as

<small>
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathscr{L}(\underline{\theta}=\theta|\underline{t}=t_1,t_2)&=\prod_{i=1}^2 f(t_i|\theta)\\\\
&=\left(\frac{1}{\theta}\right)\exp\left[-\frac{`r obs[1]`}{\theta}\right]\times \left(\frac{1}{\theta}\right)\exp\left[-\frac{`r obs[2]`}{\theta}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$
</small>
</li>
    
<li>
<focus>Our challenge</focus> is to find the value of $\theta$ that maximizes this joint probability/likelihood
</li>

<li>
This can be accomplished in three ways (we'll walk through each one for the <purple>exponential</purple> distribution)

<ul>
<li>Analytically</li>
<li>Graphically</li>
<li> Numerically</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li>
<focus>The analytical solution</focus>

<ul>
<li> Calculus says that a function $f(t)$ attains a maximum (or minimum) value at $t$ if

$$
\frac{df(t)}{dt}=0
$$
</li>

<li>In this case, $f(t)$ is the joint probability/likelihood of the data, assuming the <purple>exponential</purple> distribution is correct, e.g.
    
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathscr{L}(\theta|t_i)&=\prod_{i=1}^n f(t_i|\theta)\\\\
&=\prod_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{1}{\theta}\right)\exp\left[-\frac{t_i}{\theta}\right]\\\\
&=\left(\frac{1}{\theta}\right)^n\exp\left[-\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{t_i}{\theta}\right]\\\\
&=\left(\frac{1}{\theta}\right)^n\exp\left[-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n t_i}{\theta}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$
</li>

<li>
Usually it's easier to find the derivative of the log-likelihoood function $\mathcal{L}=\log[\mathscr{L}]$
</li>

<li>
In the equations below we find the log-likelihood function AND take the derivative<br><focus>I'm combining steps here - Don't freak out</focus>
    
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\theta}&=\frac{\partial\left[ n\left(\log[1]-\log[\theta]\right)-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n t_i}{\theta}\right]}{\partial\theta}\\\\
&=-\frac{n}{\theta}+\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n t_i}{\theta^2}
\end{aligned}
$$
</li>

<li> 
Setting this derivative equal to zero and solving for $\theta$ reveals that

$$
\hat{\theta}_{_{MLE}}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n t_i}{n}
$$
</li>

<li>
<focus>NOTE:</focus> For completeness, we should have also found the second derivative to ensure that the critical value is in fact a maximum and not a minimum.
</li>

<li>
Substituting the two observations results in the following value

$$
\hat{\theta}_{_{MLE}}=\frac{`r obs[1]`+`r obs[2]`}{2}=`r theta`
$$
</li>

<li>
Finally, (<red>whew!</red>) we can compute the maximum joint probability/likelihood of observating $(`r obs`)$ - assuming the exponential distribution is correct)

<small>
$$\begin{aligned}
\prod_{i=1}^2 f(t_i|\theta=`r theta`)&=\left(\frac{1}{`r theta`}\right)\exp\left[-\frac{`r obs[1]`}{`r theta`}\right]\times\left(\frac{1}{`r theta`}\right)\exp\left[-\frac{`r obs[2]`}{`r theta`}\right]\\\\
&=\mathbf{`r log.like`}
\end{aligned}
$$
</small>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
To summarize - we determined (<red>analytically</red>) that...

<ul>

<li>
The member of the exponential distribution family that best-fits the data $(`r obs[1:2]`)$ was the member for which $\theta=`r theta`$
</li>

<li>
The joint probability/likelihood of this model is $`r log.like`$ 
</li>

<li>
The value $`r log.like`$ represents the best that the exponential distribution can do to model this data and will be used to compare with the other distributions
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<focus>Finding $\hat{\theta_{_{MLE}}}$ Graphically</focus>

<ul>

<li>
The plot below shows the joint prabability/likelihood of the <purple>exponential</purple> distribution to model the observations $(`r obs`)$ for various values of $\hat{\theta}$
</li>

<li>
The vertical line shows the value of $\hat{\theta}_{_{MLE}}$ that we computed analytically correndonds to the value of $\theta$ that maximizes the joint probability on the plot
</li>

<li>
It should be clear that graphical solutions can be faster and easier than analytical solutions, but they can also be less accurate
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
