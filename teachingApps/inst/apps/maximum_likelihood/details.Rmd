### Maximum Likelihood Regularity Conditions

1. The support region for a selected model does not depend on $\theta$

2. The parameters are identifiable (i.e., for $\theta_1\ne\theta_2,\; f(t|\theta_1)\ne f(t|\theta_2), \;\forall t$)

3. The value of $\hat{\theta}_{_{MLE}}$ is on the interior of the parameter space $\Theta$

4. $f(t|\underline{\theta})$ has a $3^{rd}$ mixed partial derivative

5. $E\left[\frac{\partial^{2}\log(f(t|\theta))}{\partial\theta(\partial\theta)^T}\right]=\frac{\partial^2 E\left[\log(f(t|\theta))\right]}{\partial\theta(\partial\theta)^T}$

6. Elements of $\mathscr{I}_{\theta}$ are finite and $\mathscr{I}_{\theta}$ is a positive-definite matrix

### Properties of the Likelihood Function $\mathscr{L}$

1. $\mathscr{L}(\theta|\underline{x})\ge 0$

2. $\mathscr{L}(\theta|\underline{x})$ is not a pdf i.e. $\int \mathscr{L}(\theta|\underline{x})\;d\theta \ne 1$

3. Suggests (relatively) which values of $\theta$ are more likely to have generated the observed data $\underline{x}$ (assuming the chosen parametric model is correct)

4. If it exists, we say that the value of $\underline{\theta}$ that maximizes $\mathscr{L}(\underline{\theta}|\underline{x})$ is the maximum likelihood estimator (denoted $\hat{\theta}_{_{MLE}}$)

5. We often try to find $\hat{\theta}_{_{MLE}}$ by maximizing the log-likelihood function 
$$\mathcal{L}(\underline{\theta}|\underline{x})=\log\left[\mathscr{L}(\underline{\theta}|\underline{x})\right]$$

### The likelihood is equal to the joint probability of the data

- Mathematically this is expressed as

$$\mathscr{L}(\underline{\theta}|\underline{x})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathscr{L}_{i}(\underline{\theta}|x_i)=f(\underline{x}|\underline{\theta})=\prod_{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i}|\underline{\theta}),\;\;\text{if}\;x_{i}\; iid$$

- Both $f(t|\underline{\theta})$ and $\mathscr(\underline{\theta})$ start with a distributional assumption

- $f(\underline{x}|\underline{\theta})$ relates 

    + The probability (likelihood) of observing data $\underline{x}=x_1,...,x_n, \;\;n\in[1,\infty)$ from a specified distribution of the form $f(x|\theta)$ 

- Is a function of $\underline{x}$ assuming $\underline{\theta}=\theta_{1},\theta_{2},...$ are <focus>known</focus>

- What data $\underline{x}$ are most likely to be produced by a distribution with parameters $\underline{\theta}$?


- $f(x_i|\underline{\theta})$ is the probability density associated with observation $x_i$

- But, this statement comes with the following assumptions

    1) We know (or at least have specified) a functional form values for $\theta$
    
    2) We know (or at least have specified) values for $\theta$

$\mathscr{L}(\underline{\theta}|\underline{x})$ 

- Is a function of $\underline{\theta}$ assuming $\underline{x}=x_{1},...,x_{n}$ has already been observed

- What values of $\underline{\theta}$ are most likely to have produced $\underline{x}$?
