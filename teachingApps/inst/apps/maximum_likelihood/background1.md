### Maximum Likelihood (ML) Estimation

- Is a versitile method used to fit statistical models to data

- Can be applied to a wide variety of statistical models and data structures

- Provides a numerical procedure to discern which model best-fits a data set (among a set of selected models)

- Produces efficient and consistent estimators under certain <focus>regularity conditions</focus>
    
    + Efficient - Estimates $\mathbf{\underline{\theta}}=\theta_{1},\theta_{2},...$ in the "best-manner"
    
    + Consistent - $\text{as}\;n\rightarrow\infty, \;\;f(\hat{\theta}_{_{MLE}}\xrightarrow{L}\theta)$ 

### About this app

- The `Silly Example` tab

    + Walks through a 'not-so-real-world' example showing how ML Estimation works

- The `Details` Tab

    + Presents an interactive simulation showing how likelihood values are computed for different distributions
