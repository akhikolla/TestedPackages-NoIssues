<h3>About the Binomial Distribution</h3>

- Similar to the hypergeometric distribution, but the sampling is done with replacement instead of without replacement

- It is a distribution of the number of successes in n independent trials, where each trial has a binary outcome (success/failure)

- It has to have a fixed number of trials, n

- The probability of success, p,  remains the same across trials
