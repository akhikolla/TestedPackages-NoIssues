- R, like most languages, does not maximize functions - but <red>minimizes</red> them

- Therefore, to find `maximum` values we minimize the <u>negative</u> of a function

- <focus>This is why `joint.exp()` returns a negative<focus>

- This does not change the value of the point at which the maximum value occurs (returned by `$par`)

- But, we must remember that the value of the likelihood function (returned by `$objective`) must be multiplied by -1
