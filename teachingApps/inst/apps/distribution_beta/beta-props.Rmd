<h3>Properties of the Beta Distribution</h3>

- Is the continuous counterpart to the geometric distribution

- Describes the inter-arrival time durations between events in a homogeneous Poisson process

- Is used to model the "useful-life" region of the bathtub curve

- Implies that failures are due to random events or chance

- Is a "memoryless" distribution

- Is one of the most commonly used lifetime distributions in reliability analyses

- Is the simplest distribution used in the analysis of reliability data

- In real world scenarios, assuming exponentially distributed failure times is rarely valid
