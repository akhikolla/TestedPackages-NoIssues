<h3>About the Poisson Distribution</h3>

- Commonly used for the analysis of certain kinds of recurrence data

- It is used in queuing theory

- It has independent events

- It has a constant rate of occurrence

- Can be derived from either the binomial, hypergeometric or exponential distribution

- The mean is equal to the variance

- Only has one parameter, $\lambda$, which represents the average number of events in a given time period
