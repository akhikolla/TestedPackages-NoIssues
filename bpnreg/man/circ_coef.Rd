\title{Compute circular coefficients from linear coefficients}
\usage{
circ_coef(a1, a2, b1, b2)
}
\arguments{
\item{a1}{intercept of the first linear component.}

\item{a2}{intercept of the second linear component.}

\item{b1}{slope of the first linear component.}

\item{b2}{slope of the second linear component.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the coordinates of the inflection point of a
  circular effect, the slope at the inflection point and the unsigned and
  signed shortest distance to the origin.
