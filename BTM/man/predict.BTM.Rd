\title{Predict function for a Biterm Topic Model}
\usage{
\method{predict}{BTM}(object, newdata, type = c("sum_b", "sub_w", "mix"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class BTM as returned by \code{\link{BTM}}}

\item{newdata}{a tokenised data frame containing one row per token with 2 columns 
\itemize{
\item the first column is a context identifier (e.g. a tweet id, a document id, a sentence id, an identifier of a survey answer, an identifier of a part of a text)
\item the second column is a column called of type character containing the sequence of words occurring within the context identifier 
}}

\item{type}{character string with the type of prediction. 
Either one of 'sum_b', 'sub_w' or 'mix'. Default is set to 'sum_b' as indicated in the paper, 
indicating to sum over the the expectation of the topic proportions of biterms generated from the document. For the other approaches, please inspect the paper.}

\item{...}{not used}
}
\value{
a matrix containing containing P(z|d) - the probability of the topic given the biterms.\cr
The matrix has one row for each unique doc_id (context identifier)
which contains words part of the dictionary of the BTM model and has K columns, 
one for each topic.
}
\description{
Classify new text alongside the biterm topic model.\cr

To infer the topics in a document, it is assumed that the topic proportions of a document 
is driven by the expectation of the topic proportions of biterms generated from the document.
