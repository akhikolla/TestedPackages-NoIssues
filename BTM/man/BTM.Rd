\title{Construct a Biterm Topic Model on Short Text}
\usage{
BTM(
  data,
  k = 5,
  alpha = 50/k,
  beta = 0.01,
  iter = 1000,
  window = 15,
  background = FALSE,
  trace = FALSE,
  biterms,
  detailed = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a tokenised data frame containing one row per token with 2 columns 
\itemize{
\item the first column is a context identifier (e.g. a tweet id, a document id, a sentence id, an identifier of a survey answer, an identifier of a part of a text)
\item the second column is a column called of type character containing the sequence of words occurring within the context identifier 
}}

\item{k}{integer with the number of topics to identify}

\item{alpha}{numeric, indicating the symmetric dirichlet prior probability of a topic P(z). Defaults to 50/k.}

\item{beta}{numeric, indicating the symmetric dirichlet prior probability of a word given the topic P(w|z). Defaults to 0.01.}

\item{iter}{integer with the number of iterations of Gibbs sampling}

\item{window}{integer with the window size for biterm extraction. Defaults to 15.}

\item{background}{logical if set to \code{TRUE}, the first topic is set to a background topic that 
equals to the empirical word distribution. This can be used to filter out common words. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{trace}{logical indicating to print out evolution of the Gibbs sampling iterations. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{biterms}{optionally, your own set of biterms to use for modelling.\cr 
This argument should be a data.frame with column names doc_id, term1, term2 and cooc, indicating how many times each biterm (as indicated by terms term1 and term2) 
is occurring within a certain doc_id. The field cooc indicates how many times this biterm happens with the doc_id. \cr
Note that doc_id's which are not in \code{data} are not allowed, as well as terms (in term1 and term2) which are not also in \code{data}.
See the examples.\cr 
If provided, the \code{window} argument is ignored and the \code{data} argument will only be used to calculate the background word frequency distribution.}

\item{detailed}{logical indicating to return detailed output containing as well the vocabulary and the biterms used to construct the model. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
an object of class BTM which is a list containing
\itemize{
\item{model: a pointer to the C++ BTM model}
\item{K: the number of topics}
\item{W: the number of tokens in the data}
\item{alpha: the symmetric dirichlet prior probability of a topic P(z)}
\item{beta: the symmetric dirichlet prior probability of a word given the topic P(w|z)}
\item{iter: the number of iterations of Gibbs sampling}
\item{background: indicator if the first topic is set to the background topic that equals the empirical word distribution.}
\item{theta: a vector with the topic probability p(z) which is determinated by the overall proportions of biterms in it}
\item{phi: a matrix of dimension W x K with one row for each token in the data. This matrix contains the probability of the token given the topic P(w|z).
the rownames of the matrix indicate the token w}
\item{vocab: a data.frame with columns token and freq indicating the frequency of occurrence of the tokens in \code{data}. Only provided in case argument \code{detailed} is set to \code{TRUE}}
\item{biterms: the result of a call to \code{terms} with type set to biterms, containing all the biterms used in the model. Only provided in case argument \code{detailed} is set to \code{TRUE}}
}

\description{
The Biterm Topic Model (BTM) is a word co-occurrence based topic model that learns topics by modeling word-word co-occurrences patterns (e.g., biterms)

\itemize{
\item A biterm consists of two words co-occurring in the same context, for example, in the same short text window. 
\item BTM models the biterm occurrences in a corpus (unlike LDA models which model the word occurrences in a document). 
\item It's a generative model. In the generation procedure, a biterm is generated by drawing two words independently from a same topic z. 
In other words, the distribution of a biterm \eqn{b=(wi,wj)} is defined as: \eqn{P(b) = \sum_k{P(wi|z)*P(wj|z)*P(z)}} 
where k is the number of topics you want to extract.
\item Estimation of the topic model is done with the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Where estimates are provided for \eqn{P(w|k)=phi} and \eqn{P(z)=theta}.
}
}
\note{
A biterm is defined as a pair of words co-occurring in the same text window. 
If you have as an example a document with sequence of words \code{'A B C B'}, and assuming the window size is set to 3, 
that implies there are two text windows which can generate biterms namely 
text window \code{'A B C'} with biterms \code{'A B', 'B C', 'A C'} and text window \code{'B C B'} with biterms \code{'B C', 'C B', 'B B'}
A biterm is an unorder word pair where \code{'B C' = 'C B'}. Thus, the document \code{'A B C B'} will have the following biterm frequencies: \cr
\itemize{
\item 'A B': 1 
\item 'B C': 3
\item 'A C': 1
\item 'B B': 1
}
These biterms are used to create the model.
