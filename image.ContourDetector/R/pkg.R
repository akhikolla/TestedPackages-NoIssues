#' @description Unsupervised Smooth Contour Detection.\cr
#' 
#' Following the a contrario approach, the starting point is defining the conditions where contours should not be detected: 
#' soft gradient regions contaminated by noise. To achieve this, low frequencies are removed from the input image. 
#' Then, contours are validated as the frontiers separating two adjacent regions, one with significantly larger values 
#' than the other. Significance is evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test to determine whether the samples were drawn 
#' from the same distribution or not. This test makes no assumption on the distributions. 
#' The resulting algorithm is similar to the classic Marr-Hildreth edge detector, 
#' with the addition of the statistical validation step. Combined with heuristics based on the Canny and Devernay methods, 
#' an efficient algorithm is derived producing sub-pixel contours.
