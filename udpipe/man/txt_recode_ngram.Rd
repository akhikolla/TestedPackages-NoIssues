\title{Recode words with compound multi-word expressions}
\usage{
txt_recode_ngram(x, compound, ngram, sep = " ")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character vector of words where you want to replace tokens with compound multi-word expressions.
This is generally a character vector as returned by the token column of \code{as.data.frame(udpipe_annotate(txt))}}

\item{compound}{a character vector of compound words multi-word expressions indicating terms which can be considered as one word. 
For example \code{c('New York', 'Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest')}.}

\item{ngram}{a integer vector of the same length as \code{compound} indicating how many terms there are in the specific compound multi-word expressions
given by \code{compound}, where \code{compound[i]} contains \code{ngram[i]} words. 
So if \code{x} is \code{c('New York', 'Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest')}, the ngram would be \code{c(2, 3)}}

\item{sep}{separator used when the compounds were constructed by combining the words together into a compound multi-word expression. Defaults to a space: ' '.}
}
\value{
the same character vector \code{x} where elements in \code{x} will be replaced by compound multi-word expression. 
If will give preference to replacing with compounds with higher ngrams if these occur. See the examples.
}
\description{
Replace in a character vector of tokens, tokens with compound multi-word expressions.
So that \code{c("New", "York")} will be \code{c("New York", NA)}.
}
\examples{
x <- c("I", "went", "to", "New", "York", "City", "on", "holiday", ".")
y <- txt_recode_ngram(x, compound = "New York", ngram = 2, sep = " ")
data.frame(x, y)

keyw <- data.frame(keyword = c("New-York", "New-York-City"), ngram = c(2, 3))
y <- txt_recode_ngram(x, compound = keyw$keyword, ngram = keyw$ngram, sep = "-")
data.frame(x, y)

## Example replacing adjectives followed by a noun with the full compound word
data(brussels_reviews_anno)
x <- subset(brussels_reviews_anno, language == "nl")
keyw <- keywords_phrases(x$xpos, term = x$token, pattern = "JJNN", 
                         is_regex = TRUE, detailed = FALSE)
head(keyw)
x$term <- txt_recode_ngram(x$token, compound = keyw$keyword, ngram = keyw$ngram)
head(x[, c("token", "term", "xpos")], 12)
