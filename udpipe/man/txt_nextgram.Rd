\alias{txt_nextgram}
\title{Based on a vector with a word sequence, get n-grams (looking forward)}
\usage{
txt_nextgram(x, n = 2, sep = " ")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character vector where each element is just 1 term or word}

\item{n}{an integer indicating the ngram. Values of 1 will keep the x, a value of 2 will
append the next term to the current term, a value of 3 will append the subsequent
term and the term following that term to the current term}

\item{sep}{a character element indicating how to \code{\link{paste}} the subsequent words together}
}
\value{
a character vector of the same length of \code{x} with the n-grams
}
\description{
If you have annotated your text using \code{\link{udpipe_annotate}},
your text is tokenised in a sequence of words. Based on this vector of words in sequence
getting n-grams comes down to looking at the next word and the subsequent word andsoforth.
These words can be \code{pasted} together to form an n-gram containing
the current word, the next word up, the subsequent word, ...

\examples{
x <- sprintf("\%s\%s", LETTERS, 1:26)
txt_nextgram(x, n = 2)

data.frame(words = x,
           bigram = txt_nextgram(x, n = 2),
           trigram = txt_nextgram(x, n = 3, sep = "-"),
           quatrogram = txt_nextgram(x, n = 4, sep = ""),
           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

x <- c("A1", "A2", "A3", NA, "A4", "A5")
data.frame(x, 
           bigram = txt_nextgram(x, n = 2, sep = "_"),
           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
