\title{Remove terms occurring with low frequency from a Document-Term-Matrix and documents with no terms}
\usage{
dtm_remove_lowfreq(dtm, minfreq = 5, maxterms, remove_emptydocs = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dtm}{an object returned by \code{\link{document_term_matrix}}}

\item{minfreq}{integer with the minimum number of times the term should occur in order to keep the term}

\item{maxterms}{integer indicating the maximum number of terms which should be kept in the \code{dtm}. The argument is optional.}

\item{remove_emptydocs}{logical indicating to remove documents containing no more terms after the term removal is executed. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
a sparse Matrix as returned by \code{sparseMatrix} 
where terms with low occurrence are removed and documents without any terms are also removed
}
\description{
Remove terms occurring with low frequency from a Document-Term-Matrix and documents with no terms

data(brussels_reviews_anno)
x <- subset(brussels_reviews_anno, xpos == "NN")
x <- x[, c("doc_id", "lemma")]
x <- document_term_frequencies(x)
dtm <- document_term_matrix(x)
