\title{Convert a matrix of word vectors to word2vec format}
\usage{
as_word2vec(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix with word vectors where the rownames indicate the word or token and the number of columns
of the matrix indicate the side of the word vector}
}
\value{
a character string of length 1 containing the word vectors in word2vec format which can be written to a file on disk
}
\description{
The word2vec format provides in the first line the dimension of the word vectors and in the following lines one
has the elements of the wordvector where each line covers one word or token.\cr

The function is basically a utility function which allows one to write wordvectors created with other R packages in 
the well-known word2vec format which is used by \code{udpipe_train} to train the dependency parser.
}
\examples{
wordvectors <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100, ncol = 10)
rownames(wordvectors) <- sprintf("word\%s", seq_len(nrow(wordvectors)))
wv <- as_word2vec(wordvectors)
cat(wv)

f <- file(tempfile(fileext = ".txt"), encoding = "UTF-8")
cat(wv, file = f)
close(f)
