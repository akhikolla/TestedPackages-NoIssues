#' @title Perform dictionary-based sentiment analysis on a tokenised data frame
#' @description This function identifies words which have a positive/negative meaning, with the addition of some basic logic regarding occurrences of amplifiers/deamplifiers and negators
#' in the neighbourhood of the word which has a positive/negative meaning.
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{If a negator is occurring in the neigbourhood, positive becomes negative or vice versa.}
#'  \item{If amplifiers/deamplifiers occur in the neigbourhood, these amplifier weight is added to the sentiment polarity score.}
#' }
#' This function took inspiration from qdap::polarity but was completely re-engineered to allow to calculate similar things on 
#' a udpipe-tokenised dataset. It works on a sentence level and the negator/amplification logic can not surpass a boundary defined
#' by the PUNCT upos parts of speech tag.\cr
#' 
#' Note that if you prefer to build a supervised model to perform sentiment scoring 
#' you might be interested in looking at the ruimtehol R package \url{https://github.com/bnosac/ruimtehol} instead.
#' @param x a data.frame with the columns doc_id, paragraph_id, sentence_id, upos and the column as indicated in \code{term}. This is exactly what \code{\link{udpipe}} returns.
#' @param term a character string with the name of a column of \code{x} where you want to apply to sentiment scoring upon
#' @param polarity_terms data.frame containing terms which have positive or negative meaning. This data frame should contain the columns
#' term and polarity where term is of type character and polarity can either be 1 or -1.
#' @param polarity_negators a character vector of words which will invert the meaning of the \code{polarity_terms} such that -1 becomes 1 and vice versa
#' @param polarity_amplifiers a character vector of words which amplify the \code{polarity_terms}
#' @param polarity_deamplifiers a character vector of words which deamplify the \code{polarity_terms}
#' @param amplifier_weight weight which is added to the polarity score if an amplifier occurs in the neighbourhood
#' @param n_before integer indicating how many words before the \code{polarity_terms} word one has to look to find negators/amplifiers/deamplifiers to apply its logic
#' @param n_after integer indicating how many words after the \code{polarity_terms} word one has to look to find negators/amplifiers/deamplifiers to apply its logic
#' @param constrain logical indicating to make sure the aggregated sentiment scores is between -1 and 1
#' @export
#' @return a list containing 
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{data: the \code{x} data.frame with 2 columns added: polarity and sentiment_polarity. 
#'  \itemize{
#'  \item{The column polarity being just the polarity column of the \code{polarity_terms} dataset corresponding to the polarity of the \code{term} you apply the sentiment scoring} 
#'  \item{The colummn sentiment_polarity is the value where the amplifier/de-amplifier/negator logic is applied on. }
#'  }
#'  }
#'  \item{overall: a data.frame with one row per doc_id containing the columns doc_id, sentences,
#'  terms, sentiment_polarity, terms_positive, terms_negative, terms_negation and terms_amplification 
#'  providing the aggregate sentiment_polarity score of the dataset \code{x} by doc_id as well as 
#'  the terminology causing the sentiment, the number of sentences and the number of non punctuation terms in the document.}
