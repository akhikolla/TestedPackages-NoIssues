\title{2-mode to 1-mode transformation}
\usage{
mode_transformation(x, which = c("both", "high", "low"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a bipartite graph object. Data must be bipartite and must not
be multilevel}

\item{which}{one of "both", "high" or "low". High indicates to do the
transformation to the higher level. Low indicates to do the transformation
to the lower level. Both returns a list with both networks.}
}
\value{
If which is set to "both" (default), returns a list with two
  generated networks. If which is set to "high" or "low", returns a graph
  object.
}
\description{
This function is a wrapper to the \code{\link[igraph]{bipartite_projection}}
  function from the 'igraph' package. It transforms a bipartite (2-mode)
  network to two 1-mode networks. It is recommended to use it as an analysis
  tool for a bipartite network that was obtained from
  \code{\link{extract_mesolevel}}.
}
\details{
The function counts 1 edge when two vertices of the
  higher level share a vertex of the lower level and 1 edge when two vertices
  of the lower level are affiliated to the same vertex in the higher level.
}
\examples{
# First, extract the mesolevel of the multilevel network
affiliation <- extract_mesolevel(linked_sim)

# To obtain both transformed networks
transformed <- mode_transformation(affiliation)

# To obtain just one transformed network
high_transformed <- mode_transformation(affiliation, which = "high")
