\usage{
is_multilevel(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A graph object.}
}
\description{
Checks whether a network (a graph) is multilevel
  according to the \emph{linked design} proposed by Lazega et al (2008).
}
\details{
A multilevel network can be defined as a network with two kinds
  of vertex and two kinds of edges: Vertices on the lower level are,
  usually, individuals. Vertices on the higher level are, usually,
  organizations, collectivities or other kinds of social joint
  structures. The first kind of edges are those between the vertices
  of the higher level and between the vertices of the lower level. The
  second kind of edges are those between the vertices of different levels
  (affiliation ties).

  Put another way, a multilevel network is a bipartite network (2-mode)
  that has ties between nodes on both levels.
