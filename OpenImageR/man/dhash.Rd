\title{calculation of the 'dhash' of an image}
\usage{
dhash(gray_image, hash_size = 8, MODE = "hash", resize = "nearest")
}
\arguments{
\item{gray_image}{a (2-dimensional) matrix or data frame}

\item{hash_size}{an integer specifying the hash size (should be less than number of rows or columns of the gray_image)}

\item{MODE}{one of 'hash' (returns the hash of the image), 'binary' (returns binary identifier of the image)}

\item{resize}{corresponds to one of 'nearest', 'bilinear'}
}
\value{
either a hash-string or a binary vector
}
\description{
This function calculates the dhash of an image
}
\details{
The function is a modification of the 'dhash' function of the imagehash package [ please consult the COPYRIGHT file ]. In comparison to
average_hash and phash, the dhash algorithm takes into consideration the difference between adjacent pixels.
}
\examples{

image = readImage(system.file("tmp_images", "3.jpeg", package = "OpenImageR"))

image = rgb_2gray(image)

res_hash = dhash(image, hash_size = 8, MODE = 'hash')

res_binary = dhash(image, hash_size = 8, MODE = 'binary')

}
