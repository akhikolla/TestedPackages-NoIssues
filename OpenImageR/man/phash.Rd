\title{calculation of the 'phash' of an image}
\usage{
phash(
  gray_image,
  hash_size = 8,
  highfreq_factor = 4,
  MODE = "hash",
  resize = "nearest"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gray_image}{a (2-dimensional) matrix or data frame}

\item{hash_size}{an integer specifying the hash size (hash_size * highfreq_factor should be less than number of rows or columns of the gray_image)}

\item{highfreq_factor}{an integer specyfing the highfrequency factor (hash_size * highfreq_factor should be less than number of rows or columns of the gray_image)}

\item{MODE}{one of 'hash' (returns the hash of the image), 'binary' (returns binary identifier of the image)}

\item{resize}{corresponds to one of 'nearest', 'bilinear' (resizing method)}
}
\value{
either a hash-string or a binary vector
}
\description{
This function calculates the phash of an image
}
\details{
The function is a modification of the 'phash' function of the imagehash package [ please consult the COPYRIGHT file ]. The phash algorithm 
extends the average_hash by using the discrete cosine transform.
}
\examples{

image = readImage(system.file("tmp_images", "2.jpg", package = "OpenImageR"))

image = rgb_2gray(image)

res_hash = phash(image, hash_size = 6, highfreq_factor = 3, MODE = 'hash')

res_binary = phash(image, hash_size = 6, highfreq_factor = 3, MODE = 'binary')

}
