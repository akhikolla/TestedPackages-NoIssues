#' Avoca permanent plot dataset
#'
#' Example dataset with data from 8 permanent forest plots located on slopes of a valley in the New Zealand Alps. 
#' The study area is mountainous and centered on the Craigieburn Range (Southern Alps), South Island, New Zealand.  
#' Forests plots are almost monospecific, being the mountain beech (Fuscospora cliffortioides) the main dominant tree species. 
#' Previously forests consisted of largely mature stands, but some of them were affected by different disturbances during the sampling period (1972-2009) which includes 9 surveys.
