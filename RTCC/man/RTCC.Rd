\title{RTCC: Detecting trait clustering in environmental gradients
with the Randomized Trait Community Clustering method}
\description{
A set of functions which allows to determine if the observed traits
present clustering/overdispersion patterns on the observed samples,
and if so, to stablish if the observed pattern is linked to the effect
of an environmental gradient.
}
\details{
The study of phenotypic similarities and differences within species along
  environmental gradients might be used as a powerful tool complementing
  taxon-based approaches when assesing the contribution of stochastic and
  deterministic processes in community assembly. For this, this package allows an
  easy implementation of a method for detecting clustering/overdispersion patterns
  along an environmental gradient (Triado-Margarit et al., 2019). A first function
  assesses if the observed traits exhibit a clustering/overdispersion pattern on the
  tested samples. If positive, two subsequent functions determine whether the
  observed pattern is linked to the effect of an environmental varible and its
  statistical significance.

\section{Data entry}{
 The data consists on presence-absence observations
   along a measured environmental gradient and trait quantitative
   information of the observed organisms.
