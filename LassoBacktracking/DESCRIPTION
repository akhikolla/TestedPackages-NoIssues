Description: Implementation of the algorithm introduced in Shah, R. D.
    (2016) <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/13-515/13-515.pdf>.
    Data with thousands of predictors can be handled. The algorithm
    performs sequential Lasso fits on design matrices containing
    increasing sets of candidate interactions. Previous fits are used to greatly
    speed up subsequent fits so the algorithm is very efficient.
