striprtf: Extract Text from RTF (Rich Text Format) File
=======================================================

Installation
------------

This package is now on CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("striprtf")
```

Alternatively, install development version from Github using `devtools` library.

``` r
devtools::install_github("kota7/striprtf")
```

Usage
-----

The package exports two main functions:

-   `read_rtf` takes a path to a Rich Text Format (RTF) file and extracts plain text out of it.
-   `strip_rtf` does the same with string input instead of file path.

``` r
library(striprtf)
x <- read_rtf(system.file("extdata/king.rtf", package = "striprtf"))
head(x)

#> [2] "Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
#> [3] "But 100 years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
#> [4] "In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men -- yes, black men as well as white men -- would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
#> [5] "It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check that has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
#> [6] "But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children."

Important Change in the Function Names
--------------------------------------

From ver 0.3.1, the functions are renamed as follows:

-   `striprtf` --&gt; `read_rtf`
-   `rtf2text` --&gt; `strip_rtf`

See NEWS for other updates.

Tables (v0.4.1+)
----------------

Supports tables in documents. Use `row_start`, `row_end`, `cell_end` arguments to adjust the format the tables. Suppports line breaks (and other special characters) within cells.

The parser is made robust from v0.4.5.
Tested with files generated by Microsoft Word, Google Doc, and Libre Office Writer.
