## Overview

The R package **reda** provides functions for

- simulating survival, recurrent event, and multiple event data from stochastic
  process point of view;
- exploring and modeling recurrent event data through the mean cumulative
  function (MCF) by the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard rate
  function, and gamma frailty model with spline rate function;
- comparing two-sample recurrent event responses with the pseudo-score tests.


## Installation

You can install the released version from [CRAN][cran-url].

```R
install.packages("reda")
```


## Getting Started

[Online documentation][homepage] provides function documentations and includes
package vignettes for
- [exploring and modeling recurrent event data][reda-intro].
- [introduction to formula response function Recur()][reda-Recur]
- [simulating survival and recurrent event data][reda-simulate].


## Development

The latest version of the package is under development at [GitHub][github-url].
If it is able to pass the building check by Travis CI, you may consider
installing it with the help of **remotes** by

```R
if (! require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wenjie2wang/reda", upgrade = "never")
