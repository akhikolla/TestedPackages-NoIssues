\title{Compute slopes}

\description{
Compute slopes from elevation data. The elevation values should be in map units (typically meter) for projected (planar) raster data. They should be in meters when the coordinate reference system (CRS) is longitude/latitude. 
}

\usage{
\S4method{slope}{SpatRaster}(x, neighbors=8, unit="degrees", filename="", overwrite=FALSE, wopt=list(), ...)  
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{Single layer SpatRaster with elevation values. Values should have the same unit as the map units, or in meters when the crs is longitude/latitude}
  \item{unit}{Character. 'degrees' or 'tangent'}
  \item{neighbors}{Integer. Indicating how many neighboring cells to use to compute slope for any cell. Either 8 (queen case) or 4 (rook case)}
  \item{filename}{character. Output filename. Optional}
  \item{overwrite}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, \code{filename} is overwritten}
  \item{wopt}{list. Options for writing files as in \code{\link{writeRaster}}}
  \item{...}{additional arguments. None implemented}  
}


\details{
When \code{neighbors=4} slope and aspect are computed according to Fleming and Hoffer (1979) and Ritter (1987). When \code{neigbors=8}, slope and aspect are computed according to Horn (1981). The Horn algorithm may be best for rough surfaces, and the Fleming and Hoffer algorithm may be better for smoother surfaces (Jones, 1997; Burrough and McDonnell, 1998).

If slope = 0, aspect is set to 0.5*pi radians (or 90 degrees if unit="degrees"). When computing slope or aspect, the crs of SpatRaster \code{x} must be known (may not be \code{NA}), to be able to safely differentiate between planar and longitude/latitude data.
