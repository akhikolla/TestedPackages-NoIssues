# Rphylopars
Rphylopars is an R package for conducting multivariate phylogenetic comparative analyses on datasets with missing observations and missing data. Rphylopars uses a fast linear-time algorithm and incorporate a variety of evolutionary models, including estimation of tree transformation parameters (Early-Burst, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, lambda, kappa, delta) as well as the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.
