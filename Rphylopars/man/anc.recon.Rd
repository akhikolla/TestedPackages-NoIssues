\title{
Ultra-fast maximum likelihood ancestral state reconstruction
}
\description{
This function performs ancestral state reconstruction using a fast algorithm based on Ho and Ane (2014). Contrary to \link[phytools]{fastAnc}, which reroots the tree at each internal node and recalculates the root state for each tree, this algorithm only requires a single tree traversal (Goolsby, In Review). This function is several hundred to several thousand times faster than the rerooting method used in \link[phytools]{fastAnc}, which is the next-fastest maximum likelihood ancestral state reconstruction method currently described (Revell 2012). As in the \link[phytools]{fastAnc} function, the variance and 95\% intervals of estimates are optionally returned.
}
\usage{
anc.recon(trait_data, tree, vars = FALSE, CI = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{trait_data}{
A vector or matrix of trait values. Names or row names correspond to species names. Data cannot have any missing data or within-species variation (this type of data can be handled by the \link[Rphylopars]{phylopars} function).
}
  \item{tree}{
An object of class \code{phylo}.
}
  \item{vars}{
Whether to return the variances of the restricted maximum likelihood estimates
}
  \item{CI}{
Whether to return 95\% confidence intervals of the restricted maximum likelihood estimates
}
}
\value{
A named vector of maximum likelihood ancestral states (with names corresponding to node names if available or node numbers from the tree rearranged in postorder, as obtained by the command \code{reorder(tree,"postorder")}). If vars or CI is set to TRUE, a list is returned with these values included.
