`pryr` provides tools to pry back the surface of R and dig into the details. It
has been developed in conjunction with
"[Advanced R programming](https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki)" to make
it easier to understand what's going on in R.

Install it from CRAN with `install.packages("pryr")`.

## Tools

`pryr` includes tools to:

* Make it easier to understand the internal implementation of:

  * promises: `uneval()`, `is_promise()`, `promise_info()`
  * scoping and environments: `where()`, `rls()`, `parenv()`
  * closures: `unenclose()`
  * calls and expressions: `call_tree()`
  * primitive types: `typenames()`
  * copy-on-modify: `address()`, `track_copy()`

* Inspect and understand R's OO systems:

  * Determine which OO system an object belongs to: `otype()`
  * Determine which OO system a function belongs to: `ftype()`

* Make it easier to compute on the language:

  * Alternative ways to create functions: `make_function()`, `f()`
  * A version of substitute that uses regular evaluation, `substitute_q()`, and
    one that will substitute objects in the global environment, `subs()`
  * Tools to modify language objects: `modify_lang()`
  * `dots()` and `named_dots()` to get unevaluated `...`
  * Partial function evaluation: `partial()`
  * Find all functions matching some criteria: `find_funs()`

* To use existing R tools more easily:

  * `%<d-%` and `%<a-%` for creating delayed or active bindings
  * `%<c-%` for creating constants (locked bindings)
  * `rebind` as a more user friendly version of `<<-`
