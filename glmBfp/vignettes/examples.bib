  abstract = {We develop an extension of the classical Zellner's g-prior to generalized
	linear models. Any continuous proper hyperprior f (g) can be used,
	giving rise to a large class of hyper-g priors. Connections with
	the literature are described in detail. A fast and accurate integrated
	Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood makes inference
	in large model spaces feasible. For posterior parameter estimation
	we propose an efficient and tuning-free Metropolis-Hastings sampler.
	The methodology is illustrated with variable selection and automatic
	covariate transformation in the Pima Indians diabetes data set.},
