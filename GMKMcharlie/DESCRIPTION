Description: High performance trainers for parameterizing and clustering weighted data. The Gaussian mixture (GM) module includes the conventional EM (expectation maximization) trainer, the component-wise EM trainer, the minimum-message-length EM trainer by Figueiredo and Jain (2002) <doi:10.1109/34.990138>. These trainers accept additional constraints on mixture weights and covariance eigen ratios. The K-means (KM) module offers clustering with the options of (i) deterministic and stochastic K-means++ initializations, (ii) upper bounds on cluster weights (sizes), (iii) Minkowski distances, (iv) cosine dissimilarity, (v) dense and sparse representation of data input. The package improved the typical implementations of GM and KM algorithms in various aspects. It is carefully crafted in multithreaded C++ for modeling large data in industry use.
