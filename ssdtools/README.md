`ssdtools` is an R package to plot and fit Species Sensitivity
Distributions (SSD).

SSDs are cumulative probability distributions which are fitted to
toxicity concentrations for different species as described by Posthuma
et al. (2001). The ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to fit
distributions such as the log-normal, gamma, log-logistic, log-Gumbel,
Gompertz and Weibull. The user can also provide custom distributions.
Multiple distributions can be averaged using Information Criteria.
Confidence intervals on hazard concentrations and proportions are
produced by parametric bootstrapping.

## Installation

To install the latest version from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ssdtools)

``` r
install.packages("ssdtools")
```

To install the latest development version:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bcgov/ssdtools")
```

## Introduction

`ssdtools` provides a data set for several chemicals including Boron.

``` r
library(ssdtools)
boron_data
#> # A tibble: 28 x 5
#>    Chemical Species                  Conc Group        Units
#>    <chr>    <chr>                   <dbl> <fct>        <chr>
#>  1 Boron    Oncorhynchus mykiss       2.1 Fish         mg/L 
#>  2 Boron    Ictalurus punctatus       2.4 Fish         mg/L 
#>  3 Boron    Micropterus salmoides     4.1 Fish         mg/L 
#>  4 Boron    Brachydanio rerio        10   Fish         mg/L 
#>  5 Boron    Carassius auratus        15.6 Fish         mg/L 
#>  6 Boron    Pimephales promelas      18.3 Fish         mg/L 
#>  7 Boron    Daphnia magna             6   Invertebrate mg/L 
#>  8 Boron    Opercularia bimarginata  10   Invertebrate mg/L 
#>  9 Boron    Ceriodaphnia dubia       13.4 Invertebrate mg/L 
#> 10 Boron    Entosiphon sulcatum      15   Invertebrate mg/L 
#> # … with 18 more rows
```

Multiple distributions can be fit using `ssd_fit_dists()`

``` r
boron_dists <- ssd_fit_dists(boron_data)
```

and plot using the `ggplot2` generic `autoplot`

``` r
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
autoplot(boron_dists)
```

The goodness of fit can be assessed using `ssd_gof`

``` r
ssd_gof(boron_dists)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 9
#>   dist      ad     ks    cvm   aic  aicc   bic delta weight
#>   <chr>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>
#> 1 llogis 0.487 0.0993 0.0595  241.  241.  244.  3.38  0.11 
#> 2 gamma  0.440 0.117  0.0554  238.  238.  240.  0     0.595
#> 3 lnorm  0.507 0.106  0.0703  239.  240.  242.  1.40  0.296
```

and the model-averaged 5% hazard concentration estimated using `ssd_hc`

``` r
set.seed(99)
boron_hc5 <- ssd_hc(boron_dists, ci = TRUE)
```

``` r
print(boron_hc5)
#> # A tibble: 1 x 6
#>   percent   est    se   lcl   ucl dist   
#>     <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>  
#> 1       5  1.31 0.808 0.527  3.57 average
```

Model-averaged predictions complete with confidence intervals can be
produced using the `stats` generic `predict`

``` r
set.seed(99)
boron_pred <- predict(boron_dists, ci = TRUE)
```

and plotted together with the original data using `ssd_plot`.

``` r
ssd_plot(boron_data, boron_pred,
  shape = "Group", color = "Group", label = "Species",
  xlab = "Concentration (mg/L)", ribbon = TRUE
) + expand_limits(x = 3000)
```
