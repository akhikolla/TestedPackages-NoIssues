\arguments{
\item{object}{a list, usually, the output of a call to \code{\link{gen_var}} or \code{\link{gen_vec}}.}

\item{coef}{a named list of prior specifications for the coefficients of the
models. For the default specification all prior means are set to zero and the diagonal elements of
the inverse prior variance-covariance matrix are set to 1 for coefficients corresponding to non-deterministic
terms. For deterministic coefficients the prior variances are set to 10 via \code{v_i_det = 0.1}.
The variances need to be specified as precisions, i.e. as inverses of the variances.
For further specifications such as the Minnesota prior see 'Details'.}

\item{coint}{a named list of prior specifications for cointegration coefficients of
country-specific VEC models. See 'Details'.}

\item{sigma}{a named list of prior specifications for the error variance-covariance matrix
of the country models. For the default specification of an inverse Wishart distribution
the prior degrees of freedom are set to the number of endogenous variables and
the prior variances to 1. See 'Details'.}

\item{ssvs}{optional; a named list of prior specifications for the SSVS algorithm. See 'Details'.}

\item{bvs}{optional; a named list of prior specifications for the BVS algorithm. See 'Details'.}

\value{
A list of country models.

\description{
Adds prior specifications to a list of models, which was produced by
function \code{\link{gen_var}} or \code{\link{gen_vec}}.
}
\details{
Argument \code{coef} can contain the following elements
\describe{
  \item{\code{v_i}}{a numeric specifying the prior precision of the coefficients. Default is 1.}
  \item{\code{v_i_det}}{a numeric specifying the prior precision of coefficients corresponding to deterministic terms. Default is 0.1.}
  \item{\code{coint_var}}{a logical specifying whether the prior mean of the first own lag of an
  endogenous variable in a VAR model should be set to 1. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
  \item{\code{const}}{a numeric or character specifying the prior mean of coefficients, which correspond
  to the intercept. If a numeric is provided, all prior means are set to this value.
  If \code{const = "mean"}, the means of the series of endogenous variables are used as prior means.
  If \code{const = "first"}, the first values of the series of endogenous variables are used as prior means.}
  \item{\code{minnesota}}{a list of length 4 containing parameters for the calculation of
  the Minnesota prior, where the element names are \code{kappa0}, \code{kappa1}, \code{kappa2} and \code{kappa3}.
  For the endogenous variable \eqn{i} the prior variance of the \eqn{l}th lag of regressor \eqn{j} is obtained as
  \deqn{ \frac{\kappa_{0}}{l^2} \textrm{ for own lags of endogenous variables,}} 
  \deqn{ \frac{\kappa_{0} \kappa_{1}}{l^2} \frac{\sigma_{i}^2}{\sigma_{j}^2} \textrm{ for endogenous variables other than own lags,}}
  \deqn{ \frac{\kappa_{0} \kappa_{2}}{l^2} \frac{\sigma_{i}^2}{\sigma_{j}^2} \textrm{ for exogenous variables,}}
  \deqn{ \kappa_{0} \kappa_{3} \sigma_{i}^2 \textrm{ for deterministic terms,}}
  where \eqn{\sigma_{i}} is the residual standard deviation of variable \eqn{i} of an unrestricted
  LS estimate. For exogenous variables \eqn{\sigma_{i}} is the sample standard deviation.
  
  For VEC models the function only provides priors for the non-cointegration part of the model. The
  residual standard errors \eqn{\sigma_i} are based on an unrestricted LS regression of the
  endogenous variables on the error correction term and the non-cointegration regressors.}
  \item{\code{max_var}}{a numeric specifying the maximum prior variance that is allowed for
  non-deterministic coefficients.}
}
If \code{minnesota} is specified, \code{v_i} and \code{v_i_det} are ignored.

Argument \code{coint} can contain the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{\code{coint_v_i}}{numeric between 0 and 1 specifying the shrinkage of the cointegration space prior. Default is 0.}
  \item{\code{coint_p_tau_i}}{numeric of the diagonal elements of the inverse prior matrix of
the central location of the cointegration space \eqn{sp(\beta)}. Default is 1.}
}

Argument \code{sigma} can contain the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{\code{df}}{an integer or character specifying the prior degrees of freedom of the error term. Only
  used, if the prior is invese Wishart.
  Default is \code{"k"}, which indicates the amout of endogenous variables in the respective country model.
  \code{"k + 3"} can be used to set the prior to the amount of endogenous variables plus 3. If an integer
  is provided, the degrees of freedom are set to this value in all models.
  If a VEC model is estimated, the rank \eqn{r} of the cointegration matrix
  is automatically added.}
  \item{\code{scale}}{a numeric specifying the prior error variance of endogenous variables.
  Default is 1.}
  \item{\code{shape}}{a numeric or character specifying the prior shape parameter of the error term. Only
  used, if the prior is inverse gamma.
  Default is \code{"k"}, which indicates the amout of endogenous variables in the respective country model.
  \code{"k + 3"} can be used to set the prior to the amount of endogenous variables plus 3. If a numeric
  is provided, the shape parameters are set to this value in all models.
  If a VEC model is estimated, the rank \eqn{r} of the cointegration matrix
  is automatically added.}
  \item{\code{rate}}{a numeric specifying the prior rate parameter of the error term. Only used, if the
  prior is inverse gamma.}
}
\code{df} and \code{scale} must be specified for an inverse Wishart prior. \code{shape} and \code{rate}
are required for an inverse gamma prior. For structural models only a gamma prior specification
is allowed.

Argument \code{ssvs} can contain the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{\code{inprior}}{a numeric between 0 and 1 specifying the prior probability
  of a variable to be included in the model. Default is 0.5.}
  \item{\code{tau}}{a numeric vector of two elements containing the prior standard errors
  of restricted variables (\eqn{\tau_0}) as its first element and unrestricted variables (\eqn{\tau_1})
  as its second. Default is \code{c(0.05, 10)}.}
  \item{\code{semiautomatic}}{an numeric vector of two elements containing the
  factors by which the standard errors associated with an unconstrained least squares
  estimate of the VAR model are multiplied to obtain the prior standard errors
  of restricted (\eqn{\tau_0}) and unrestricted (\eqn{\tau_1}) variables, respectively.
  This is the semiautomatic approach described in George et al. (2008).}
  \item{\code{covar}}{logical indicating if SSVS should also be applied to the error covariance matrix
  as in George et al. (2008).}
  \item{\code{exclude_det}}{logical indicating if deterministic terms should be exempted from the SSVS algorithm.}
  \item{\code{minnesota}}{a numeric vector of length 4 containing parameters for the calculation of
  the Minnesota-like inclusion priors. See below.}
}
Either \code{tau} or \code{semiautomatic} must be specified.

The argument \code{bvs} can contain the following elements
\describe{
  \item{\code{inprior}}{a numeric between 0 and 1 specifying the prior probability
  of a variable to be included in the model.}
  \item{\code{covar}}{logical indicating if BVS should also be applied to the error covariance matrix.}
  \item{\code{exclude_det}}{logical indicating if deterministic terms should be exempted from the BVS algorithm.}
  \item{\code{minnesota}}{a numeric vector of length 4 containing parameters for the calculation of
  the Minnesota-like inclusion priors. See below.}
}

If either \code{ssvs$minnesota} or \code{bvs$minnesota} is specified, prior inclusion probabilites
are calculated in a Minnesota-like fashion as
\tabular{cl}{
\eqn{\frac{\kappa_1}{l}} \tab for own lags of endogenous variables, \cr
\eqn{\frac{\kappa_2}{l}} \tab for other endogenous variables, \cr
\eqn{\frac{\kappa_3}{1 + l}} \tab for exogenous variables, \cr
\eqn{\kappa_{4}} \tab for deterministic variables, 
}
for lag \eqn{l} with \eqn{\kappa_1}, \eqn{\kappa_2}, \eqn{\kappa_3}, \eqn{\kappa_4} as the first, second,
third and forth element in \code{ssvs$minnesota} or \code{bvs$minnesota}, respectively.
