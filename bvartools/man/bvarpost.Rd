in combination with \code{\link{add_priors}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"bvar"}.
}
\description{
Produces draws from the posterior distributions of Bayesian VAR models.
}
\details{
The function implements commonly used posterior simulation algorithms for Bayesian VAR models.
It can produce posterior draws for standard BVAR models with independent normal-Wishart priors, which can
be augmented by stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) as proposed by Geroge et al. (2008) or Bayesian
variable selection (BVS) as proposed in Korobilis (2013). Both SSVS and BVS can also be applied to the
covariances of the error term.

The implementation follows the description in Chan et al. (2019), George et al. (2008) and Korobilis (2013).
For all approaches the SUR form of a VAR model is used to obtain posterior draws. The algorithm is implemented
in C++ to reduce calculation time.

The function also supports structural BVAR models, where the structural coefficients are estimated from
contemporary endogenous variables, which corresponds to the so-called (A-model). Currently, only
specifications are supported, where the structural matrix contains ones on its diagonal and all lower
triangular elements are freely estimated. Since posterior draws are obtained based on the SUR form of
the VAR model, the structural coefficients are drawn jointly with the other coefficients.

\examples{

# Get data
data("e1")
e1 <- diff(log(e1)) * 100

# Create model
model <- gen_var(e1, p = 2, deterministic = "const",
                 iterations = 100, burnin = 10)
# Chosen number of iterations and burnin should be much higher.

# Add priors
model <- add_priors(model)

# Obtain posterior draws 
object <- bvarpost(model)
