#' Variable Importance Measure for A FSM Model
#'
#' \code{var_imp} calculates the importance of the covariates of the model.
#'
#' Takes the state matrix and action vector from an already evolved model and
#' the fitness function and data used to evolve the model (or this could be test
#' data), flips the values of each of the elements in the state matrix and
#' measures the change in fitness (prediction of data) relative to the original
#' model. Then these changes are summed across columns to provide the importance
#' of each of the columns of the state matrix.
#'
#' @param state_mat Numeric matrix with rows as states and columns as
#'   predictors.
#' @param action_vec Numeric vector indicating what action to take for each
#'   state.
#' @param data Data frame that has "period" and "outcome" columns and rest of
#'   cols are predictors, ranging from one to three predictors. All of the (3-5
#'   columns) should be named.
#' @param outcome Numeric vector same length as the number of rows as data.
#' @param period Numeric vector same length as the number of rows as data.
#' @param measure Optional length one character vector that is either:
#'  "accuracy", "sens", "spec", or "ppv". This specifies what measure of
#'  predictive performance to use for training and evaluating the model. The
#'  default measure is \code{"accuracy"}. However, accuracy can be a problematic
#'  measure when the classes are imbalanced in the samples, i.e. if a class the
#'  model is trying to predict is very rare. Alternatives to accuracy are
#'  available that illuminate different aspects of predictive power. Sensitivity
#'  answers the question, `` given that a result is truly an event, what is the
#'  probability that the model will predict an event?'' Specificity answers the
#'  question, ``given that a result is truly not an event, what is the
#'  probability that the model will predict a negative?'' Positive predictive
#'  value answers, ``what is the percent of predicted positives that are
#'  actually positive?''
#'
#' @return Numeric vector the same length as the number of columns of the
#'   provided state matrix (the number of predictors in the model) with relative
#'   importance scores for each predictor.
