\title{Branch and bound for finding all most parsimonious trees}
\usage{
bab(data, tree = NULL, trace = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{an object of class phyDat.}

\item{tree}{a phylogenetic tree an object of class phylo, otherwise a
pratchet search is performed.}

\item{trace}{defines how much information is printed during optimisation.}

\item{\dots}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods}
}
\value{
\code{bab} returns all most parsimonious trees in an object of class
\code{multiPhylo}.
}
\description{
\code{bab} finds all most parsimonious trees.
}
\details{
This implementation is very slow and depending on the data may take very
long time. In the worst case all (2n-5)!! possible trees have to be
examined. For 10 species there are already 2027025 tip-labelled unrooted
trees. It only uses some basic strategies to find a lower and upper bounds
similar to penny from phylip. It uses a very basic heuristic approach of
MinMax Squeeze (Holland et al. 2005) to improve the lower bound.  On the
positive side \code{bab} is not like many other implementations restricted
to binary or nucleotide data.

data(yeast)
dfactorial(11)
# choose only the first two genes
gene12 <- subset(yeast, , 1:3158, site.pattern=FALSE)
