Description: Calibration and risk-set calibration methods for fitting Cox proportional hazard model when a binary covariate is measured intermittently. Methods include functions to fit calibration models from interval-censored data and modified partial likelihood for the proportional hazard model, Nevo et al. (2018+) <arXiv:1801.01529>.
