Compas: Conformational manipulations of protein atomic structures

This R package provides some useful functions for performing common operations on protein structures represented in PDB (Protein Data Bank) format.

Key features provided:
- Energy evaluation of a conformation using the DFIRE potential
- Fast RMSD calculations between two PDB conformations
- Cartesian coordinate calculations for 3-D positions of individual atoms and entire amino acid side chains
