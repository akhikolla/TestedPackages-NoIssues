Title: Bi-Level Selection of Conditional Main Effects
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Simon Mak
Maintainer: Simon Mak <sm769@duke.edu>
Description: Provides functions for implementing cmenet - a bi-level variable selection method for conditional main effects (see Mak and Wu (2018) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1448828>). CMEs are reparametrized interaction effects which capture the conditional impact of a factor at a fixed level of another factor. Compared to traditional two-factor interactions, CMEs can quantify more interpretable interaction effects in many problems. The current implementation performs variable selection on only binary CMEs; we are working on an extension for the continuous setting.
