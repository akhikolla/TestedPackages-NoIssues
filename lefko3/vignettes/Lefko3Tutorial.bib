	abstract = {Uncertainty associated with ecological forecasts has long been recognized, but forecast accuracy is rarely quantified. We evaluated how well data on 82 populations of 20 species of plants spanning 3 continents explained and predicted plant population dynamics. We parameterized stage-based matrix models with demographic data from individually marked plants and determined how well these models forecast population sizes observed at least 5 years into the future. Simple demographic models forecasted population dynamics poorly; only 40\% of observed population sizes fell within our forecasts’ 95\% confidence limits. However, these models explained population dynamics during the years in which data were collected; observed changes in population size during the data-collection period were strongly positively correlated with population growth rate. Thus, these models are at least a sound way to quantify population status. Poor forecasts were not associated with the number of individual plants or years of data. We tested whether vital rates were density dependent and found both positive and negative density dependence. However, density dependence was not associated with forecast error. Forecast error was significantly associated with environmental differences between the data collection and forecast periods. To forecast population fates, more detailed models, such as those that project how environments are likely to change and how these changes will affect population dynamics, may be needed. Such detailed models are not always feasible. Thus, it may be wiser to make risk-averse decisions than to expect precise forecasts from models. Habilidad de los Modelos Matriciales para Explicar el Pasado y Predecir el Futuro de las Poblaciones de Plantas
La incertidumbre asociada con el pronóstico ecológico ha sido reconocida durante un largo tiempo pero rara vez se cuantifica su seguridad. Evaluamos que tan bien la información de 82 poblaciones de 20 especies de plantas a lo largo de 3 continentes explica y predice la dinámica de población de las plantas. Realizamos parámetros con modelos matriciales con base en estadios con datos demográficos a partir de plantas marcadas individualmente y determinamos que tan bien estos modelos pronostican el tamaño de las poblaciones al menos 5 años en el futuro. Los modelos demográficos simples pronosticaron pobremente las dinámicas de población; solamente el 40\% de las poblaciones observadas cayó dentro de los límites de confianza de 85\% de nuestros pronósticos. Estos modelos sin embargo explicaron la dinámica de población a lo largo de los años en los que se colectaron datos; los cambios observados en el tamaño de la población durante el periodo de colecta de datos estuvieron positivamente correlacionados con la tasa de crecimiento de la población. Así, estos modelos son por lo menos una manera segura de cuantificar el estado de la población. Los pronósticos débiles no estuvieron asociados con el número de plantas individuales o con los años de datos. Probamos si las tasas vitales dependían de la densidad y encontramos que existe dependencia hacia la densidad tanto positiva como negativa, sin embargo la dependencia de densidad no se asoció con el error de pronóstico. El error de pronóstico estuvo significativamente asociado con diferencias ambientales entre la recolección de datos y los periodos de pronóstico. Para predecir el destino de las poblaciones se necesitan modelos más detallados, como aquellos que proyectan los cambios probables en el ambiente y como estos cambios afectarán a la dinámica de las poblaciones. Tales modelos tan detallados no siempre son factibles. Por ello puede ser mejor tomar decisiones aversas a riesgos que esperar pronósticos precisos de los modelos.},

	abstract = {We examine why demographic models should be used cautiously in Population Viability Analysis (PVA) with endangered species. We review the structure, data requirements, and outputs of analytical, deterministic single-population, stochastic single-population, metapopulation, and spatially explicit models. We believe predictions from quantitative models for endangered species are unreliable due to poor quality of demographic data used in most applications, difficulties in estimating variance in demographic rates, and lack of information on dispersal (distances, ages, mortality, movement patterns). Unreliable estimates also arise because stochastic models are difficult to validate, environmental trends and periodic fluctuations are rarely considered, the form of density dependence is frequently unknown but greatly affects model outcomes, and alternative model structures can result in very different predicted effects of management regimes. We suggest that PVA (1) evaluate relative rather than absolute rates of extinction, (2) emphasize short-time periods for making projections, (3) start with simple models and choose an approach that data can support, (4) use models cautiously to diagnose causes of decline and examine potential routes to recovery, (5) evaluate cumulative ending functions and alternative reference points rather than extinction rates, (6) examine all feasible scenarios, and (7) mix genetic and demographic currencies sparingly. Links between recovery options and PVA models should be established by conducting field tests of model assumptions and field validation of secondary model predictions.},

We describe a computer routine for carrying out the analysis under a model that assumes Markovian transitions and under reduced-paramtere verions of this model. We also introduce models that relax the Markovian assumption and allow "memory" to operate (i.e., allow dependence of the transition probabilities on the previous state). For these models, we suggest an analysis based on a conditional likelihood approach. Methods are illustrated with data from a large study on Canada geese (Branta canadensis) banded in three geographic regions. The assumption of Markovian transitions is rejected convinclingly for these data, emphasizing the importance of more general models that allow memory.},

	abstract = {Matrix projection models occupy a central role in population and conservation biology. Matrix models divide a population into discrete classes, even if the structuring trait exhibits continuous variation (e.g., body size). The integral projection model (IPM) avoids discrete classes and potential artifacts from arbitrary class divisions, facilitates parsimonious modeling based on smooth relationships between individual state and demographic performance, and can be implemented with standard matrix software. Here, we extend the IPM to species with complex demographic attributes, including dormant and active life stages, cross-classification by several attributes (e.g., size, age, and condition), and changes between discrete and continuous structure over the life cycle. We present a general model encompassing these cases, numerical methods, and theoretical results, including stable population growth and sensitivity/elasticity analysis for density-independent models, local stability analysis in density-dependent models, and optimal/evolutionarily stable strategy life-history analysis. Our presentation centers on an IPM for the thistle Onopordum illyricum based on a 6-year field study. Flowering and death probabilities are size and age dependent, and individuals also vary in a latent attribute affecting survival, but a predictively accurate IPM is completely parameterized by fitting a few regression equations.

	abstract = {Historical events have been used to explain a wide range of phenomena
including geographical distributions of species, community diversity, and population structure.
At the level of individuals, historical effects in which past conditions influence future
performance are particularly likely to occur in long-lived organisms that store resources
between seasons and that form organs months or years before their elaboration. Such carryover
mechanisms have been documented in several perennial plant species, but the implications
for population processes are poorly known. In this study, I examine how the history
of individuals influences their future performance, population dynamics, and life cycle
structure in the long-lived herb Lathyrus vernus. Overall effects of plant history on population
dynamics, in terms of growth rate, reproductive values, stable stage distribution,
and elasticities, are examined by comparing an ordinary first-order matrix model with a
second-order matrix model. In the latter, not only the present state of individuals, but also
their past state is allowed to influence future fate.
The results demonstrate that the history of individuals is sometimes important in models
of population dynamics. Plant size change over a one-year period was negatively correlated
among time intervals. Addition of the previous year’s stage in population models shifted
the growth rate from positive (l 5 1.010) to negative (l 5 0.986) and increased the
proportion of small established individuals in the stable stage distribution. If historical
effects are due to a capacity to buffer environmental variation and regain size or state, as
in L. vernus, then recruitment contributes less and stasis more to population growth than
suggested by ahistorical models. The presence of historical effects at the level of individuals,
in any form, may have important consequences for population development and should be
included in any interpretation of the life-cycle structure.},

However, the empirical examination of such patterns has so far been limited by the
fact that information on life span is mainly available in terms of discrete categories;
annuals, semelparous perennials and iteroparous perennials. We used transition
matrix models to project continuous estimates of conditional life spans from published
information on size- or stage-structured demography for 71 perennial plant
species. The projected life span ranged from 4.3 to 988.6 years and more than half of
the species had a life span of more than 35 years. Woody plants had on average a
projected life span more than four times as long as non-woody plants. Life spans
were higher in forests than in open habitats and individuals of non-clonal species
tended to have a longer life span than ramets of clonal species. Self-incompatible
plants on average lived longer than self-compatible plants. There were no clear
relations between life span and geographical region, dispersal syndrome, pollination
mode, seed size or the presence of a seed bank. We conclude that accurate estimates
of life span are central to understand how longevity is correlated to other traits
within the group of perennial plants.},

We applied mark–recapture statistics based on an information theory approach to estimate annual probabilities of dormancy in a five-year study of a threatened, perennial plant, the small yellow lady’s slipper orchid (Cypripedium calceolus ssp. parviflorum (Salisb.) Fernald). The aboveground states of 548 genets in eight patches were monitored over five years. Apparent survival probabilities (f), corrected for dormancy, were calculated. The best-fit model suggested that apparent survival was constant throughout the study for all patches, while dormancy varied additively with time among patches. The mean probability of dormancy was 0.320 +/- 0.024, with a mean maximum overestimation of 0.067 as calculated using an estimate of the probability of detection. Dormancy typically lasted for no longer than two consecutive years, although dormancy as long as four years was observed. Dormancy displayed a strong covariate relationship with spring frost days, although effects of precipitation and mean spring temperature were almost equally strong. Mean apparent survival probabilities were high in each patch (phi = 0.878), but dormancy probabilities varied considerably among patches (d = 0.188–0.672). Conventional resprouting probabilities underestimated apparent survival by a mean difference of 0.288 (range: 0.150–0.589). This novel application of mark–recapture statistics to plant demography allowed robust survival estimates that accounted for uncertainty due to an unobservable, dormant life stage.},

	doi = {10.1111/1365-2745.12281},
	abstract = {Why some herbaceous plant species refrain from sprouting in some years is a longstanding puzzle in plant ecology. When vegetatively ‘dormant’, the plant lives as a rootstock, but does not produce or maintain photosynthetic tissue. During this time, energy may be remobilized from resource reserves or acquired from mycorrhizal fungi, although the mechanisms are still poorly understood. If vegetative dormancy is adaptive, it may be in response to a harsh environment, to life-history costs, or as a bet-hedge against unpredictable environmental variability.

We tested whether vegetative dormancy is adaptive via game theoretical analysis of deterministic and stochastic ahistorical and historical life-history models parameterized with long-term census data for two long-lived plants, Anemone americana and Cypripedium parviflorum. The ahistorical deterministic model provided a test of the hypothesis that dormancy is adaptive in response to a generally harsh environment and/or short-term life-history costs, while the historical model tested whether long-term costs drove the evolution of dormancy. The stochastic ahistorical model provided a test of whether dormancy is a bet-hedging trait.

We found that vegetative dormancy is an adaptive consequence of life-history costs of growth to survival and that these costs may be operating under a variable but generally harsh environment. Such costs led to sprouting and survival probabilities that generally increased with size in adults but never reached unity and decreased with size in juveniles. Historical deterministic models particularly predicted observed sprouting frequencies, while deterministic ahistorical and stochastic models did not, suggesting although the environment is likely stressful and fluctuates between harsh and mild states, short-term costs and temporal stochasticity alone do not explain observed sprouting frequencies.

Synthesis. Life-history costs can drive the evolution of seemingly paradoxical traits. In particular, growth can lead to survival costs that may become significant in future years. These costs may be incurred via the use of stored reserves that, once used, cannot be used in the next several years. Such costs are the currency favouring the evolutionary maintenance of vegetative dormancy in two distantly related perennial plant species and may account for dormancy throughout the plant kingdom.},

	doi = {10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01616.x},
	abstract = {1. Plant demographers using matrix tools have paid special attention to vital rates of reproduction,
growth and survival. The demographic implications of plants regressing in size, or shrinking, have
been overlooked. Shrinkage has either been ignored during demographic censuses or lumped with
other demographic processes such as stasis or growth under the assumption that they have similar
demographic effects.
2. We carried out a comparative prospective analysis using classical vital rate elasticities in sizebased
projection matrices of 80 herbaceous perennial species. We analysed the correlations of the
elasticities of each demographic vital rate with the demographic life-history traits (life span, population
growth rate, etc.).
3. We also conducted a comparative loop analysis to understand the effects of shrinkage on
demographic parameters linked to size plasticity. We classified loops into ‘recruitment’ (growth that
contributes to reproduction), ‘size plasticity’ (where individuals fluctuate in size) and ‘size rigidity’
(no change in size class), and used themas the basis to explain ecological characteristics of the species.
4. Our results with classical vital rates demonstrate that considering shrinkage as a separate vital
rate increases our understanding of factors that contribute to demographic equilibrium (e.g. minimized
departure from population growth rate at equilibrium) and buffering (e.g. higher speed of
recovery after disturbance), and to reproductive strategies (e.g. mean age of parents of offspring).
5. The loop analysis results support the findings with vital rate analyses and also reveal new
patterns: high growth rates are not exclusively dominated by high elasticities of recruitment, but
also by size-plastic loops, and long-lived species experience a marginal increase in the demographic
importance of size plasticity.
6. Synthesis. This study illustrates the necessity for exploring individual demographic vital rates, as
opposed to grouping them, to advance our understanding of how different biological processes
affect population dynamics. Shrinkage is demographically important because it aids in
demographic buffering, increases survival and is related to maintenance–reproduction trade-offs.
However, shrinkage cannot be fully explored only with traditional elasticity approaches; because
shrinkage for some species is a fundamental plastic trait, its importance is more appropriately
captured with loop analyses.},

Collapsing matrices to a common dimension may facilitate such comparisons but may also bias the inferred demographic parameters. Here we examine how matrix dimension affects inferred demographic elasticities and how different collapsing criteria perform. We analyzed \$13{\textbackslash}times 13\$ matrices representing nine plant species, collapsing these matrices (i) into even \$7{\textbackslash}times 7\$ , \$5{\textbackslash}times 5\$ , \$4{\textbackslash}times 4\$ , and \$3{\textbackslash}times 3\$ matrices and (ii) into \$5{\textbackslash}times 5\$ matrices using different criteria. Stasis and fecundity elasticities increased when matrix dimension was reduced, whereas those of progression and retrogression decreased. We suggest a collapsing criterion that minimizes dissimilarities between the original‐ and collapsed‐matrix elasticities and apply it to 66 plant species to study how life span and growth form influence the relationship between matrix dimension and elasticities. Our analysis demonstrates that (i) projection matrix dimension has significant effects on inferred demographic parameters, (ii) there are better‐performing methods than previously suggested for standardizing matrix dimension, and (iii) herbaceous perennial projection matrices are particularly sensitive to changes in matrix dimensionality. For comparative demographic studies, we recommend normalizing matrices to a common dimension by collapsing higher classes and leaving the first few classes unaltered.},

	abstract = {Although many ecological properties of species respond to climate change, their evolutionary responses are poorly understood. Here, we use data from long-term demographic studies to predict evolutionary responses of three herbaceous perennial orchid species, Cypripedium parviflorum, C. candidum and Ophrys sphegodes, to predicted climate changes in the habitats they occupy. We focus on the evolution of sprouting probability, because all three species exhibit long-term vegetative dormancy, i.e. individual plants may not emerge above-ground, potentially for several consecutive years. The drivers of all major vital rates for populations of the species were analysed with general linear mixed models (GLMMs). High-dimensionality function-based matrix projection models were then developed to serve as core elements of deterministic and stochastic adaptive dynamics models used to analyse the adaptive context of sprouting in all populations. We then used regional climate forecasts, derived from high-resolution general atmospheric circulation models, of increased mean annual temperatures and spring precipitation at the occupied sites, to predict evolutionary trends in sprouting. The models predicted that C. parviflorum and O. sphegodes will evolve higher and lower probabilities of sprouting, respectively, by the end of the twenty-first century, whereas, after considerable variation, the probability of sprouting in C. candidum will return to its current level. These trends appear to be driven by relationships between mortality and size: in C. parviflorum and C. candidum, mortality is negatively related to size in the current year but positively related to growth since the previous year, whereas in O. sphegodes, mortality is positively related to size.},

Variable age-specific mortality, density dependence, and other factors may also favor iteroparity over semelparity. Here, we empirically test the adaptive benefits of greater numbers of reproductive years in a study of reproductive schedules in an experimental population of a short-lived polycarpic perennial, Plantago lanceolata. A large experimental population was established that included four cohorts with similar genetic structure. Individuals were censused for mortality, size, and reproduction for seven years. Plants experienced variable numbers of reproductive years, but one or two years were most common ({\textasciitilde}46.7\% of the population reproduced only once). The probability of flowering at least once prior to death was determined strongly by extrinsic, environmental or intrinsic but environmentally-influenced variables, including early-life size, cohort, and block, but also varied with a number of interactions involving paternal lineage. Maternal effects explained small but significant components of the variance in the number of reproductive years among individuals in each cohort, while paternal effects were significant in only two cohorts. Number of reproductive years contributed significantly to fitness in this system, more so than all other variables tested, although most of the variation in relative fitness may be attributed to ultimately environmental influences. We suggest that the high proportion of each cohort composed of plants reproducing only once may be due to environmental constraints on either growth or size. Such environmental influences, particularly on early life size, may result in small but important indirect effects on fitness.},

This yields surprisingly simple results, such as the fact that the generation time is the inverse of the sum of the elasticities of the growth rate to changes in the fertilities. This result sheds new light on the interpretation of elasticities (which as we show correspond to the frequency of events in the ancestral lineage of the population), and we use it to generalize a result known as Lebreton’s formula. Finally, we also show that the generation time can be seen as a random variable, and we give a general expression for its distribution.},

Most species displaying dormancy exhibit life history costs of sprouting, and of dormancy. Short-lived and mycoheterotrophic species have higher proportions of dormant plants than long-lived species and species with other nutritional modes. Foliage loss is associated with higher future dormancy levels, suggesting that carbon limitation promotes dormancy. Maximum dormancy duration is shorter under higher precipitation and at higher latitudes, the latter suggesting an important role for competition or herbivory. Study length affects estimates of some demographic parameters. Our results identify life historical and environmental drivers of dormancy.

Within patches, the amounts of grazing and leaf damage were size-dependent although no type of damage increased with decreased inter-neighbour distance. Once an individual had suffered meristem or leaf damage there was an increased risk of the same kind of damage occurring in the following year. 3 Damage of meristems and vertebrate grazing reduced survival, growth and fruit production of L. vernus individuals. Leaf damage reduced only survival and fruit production. 4 Meristem damage by molluscs had the most severe effects on the performance of L. vernus individuals in contrast to the general proposition that vertebrates and insects are the most important herbivores. This may be because such attacks delay the onset of assimilation thus missing part of the most favourable growing season.},

	abstract = {Interactions with animals are potentially important in shaping the life histories of plants. However, we still largely lack the quantitative information that is necessary to compare plant-animal interactions and plant life histories. This is because most studies have focused on only a single interaction and a single component of fitness. This review suggests a protocol for how plant-animal interactions, as well as other, interactions can be quantitatively investigated. I review results from the forest herb Lathyrus vernus to examine how plant performance is influenced by mollusc damage of shoot buds, vertebrate grazing, leaf damage, pre-dispersal seed predation, flower herbivory and pollinator visitation. More specifically I ask: (1) What are the effects of these interactions on components of plant fitness? (2) How do such effects translate into total fitness? (3) Do trade-offs among components of plant fitness influence the net effect of animals? (4) Are antagonistic and mutualistic interactions influenced by the same plant traits? The results illustrate why it is often necessary to monitor plants over several seasons and over all life cycle phases to assess the total effects of environmental factors. In L. vernus many components of fitness were affected by multiple interactions with animals. A large proportion of these effects was carried over to subsequent seasons and could only be detected after one or two seasons. Assessing the effects on overall performance in perennial plants is particularly difficult because fitness components have very different influence on total fitness. The matrix model approach used to estimate the effect of herbivores, seed predators and pollinators on L. vernus provides one possible way to make such assessments for organisms with complex life cycles. The results show that the cryptic damage of emerging shoots has the largest negative effects on total fitness. Correlations between different components are an essential feature of many life histories and must be incorporated into demographic models if we want to assess the net effect of environmental factors. In L. vernus costs of reproduction were present and demographic modelling showed that the positive effects of an increased seed production after additional hand-pollination on total fitness was completely offset by poorer performance in the following year. Lastly, this study provides an example of how optimal trait values can be assessed when traits influence several fitness components and several interactions. In L. vernus a higher number of flowers was correlated to both an increased fruit set and an increased risk of grazing damage and these effects were, in turn, carried over to the next season. The results clearly illustrate the limitations of inferences about phenotypic selection pressures that are based on single fitness components or single interactions. Taken together the results for L. vernus show that the selective pressure constituted by a given amount of animal interference is highly dependent on the context, in terms of both plant life history and other interactions. A life cycle approach like the one outlined in this study may avoid several problems and provide the basis for assessments of the total effects of animals on plants. Such an approach must be based on in-depth studies of plants.},

Emergence and seedling survival were studied in unmanipulated quadrates and in quadrates where additional seeds had been sown. Experimental addition of seeds increased both the proportion of quadrates with recruitment and the number of seedlings within quadrates with recruitment. The probability of seedling emergence and seedling survival were not correlated with seed or seedling density. Emergence varied among patches but not among years. First-year survival of seedlings did not vary temporally or spatially. Seedling survival was correlated with initial seedling size, but not to germination phenology or herbivory. It is concluded that recruitment in L. vernus is seed limited and that reductions in seed production caused by seed predators and herbivores may influence the number of recruits and established individuals. However, factors other than seed availability also limit recruitment, and a concept of combined seed and microsite limitation of recruitment is therefore an appropriate interpretation of the observed patterns in L. vernus.},

We examined direct and indirect phenotypic selection on the start of flowering via mutualistic and antagonistic interactions in the perennial herb Lathyrus vernus over 7 years. Flowering start influenced seed set, predispersal seed predation, and risk of grazing. These effects were in opposed directions and partly influenced different components of fitness. Combining information about effects on fitness components with information about links between fitness components and average lifetime fitness, in terms of population growth rate, showed that earlier flowering was associated with higher lifetime fitness in all years. These relationships were, however, mediated largely by variation in flower number, and direct selection on first flowering date was more variable among years. We conclude that long‐term studies correcting for indirect selection and environmental covariance are needed to understand selection on reproductive phenology and that demographic approaches are necessary to assess selection mediated by several agents and influencing several components of fitness.},

	abstract = {Matrix population models (MPMs) are powerful tools for translating demographic and life history information into a form that can be used to address a wide range of research topics, such as projecting population dynamics, evaluating stressor impacts on populations, and studying life history evolution. However, the reliability of such studies depends on the MPM being constructed in a way that accurately reflects the species’ life history. We highlight three errors commonly encountered in published MPMs: (1) failing to include survival in the fertility coefficient; (2) introducing a one-year delay in age at first reproduction; and (3) incorrectly calculating the growth rate out of a stage class. We review the sources of such errors and provide new analyses revealing the impact of such errors on model predictions, using lionfish and American alligator models as examples. To quantify the prevalence of such errors we examined and scored the original publications underlying the models in the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database. The first two errors were found in 34\% and 62\%, respectively, of the published studies; nearly all were in models that used a “postbreeding census” representation of the life cycle (in which newborns—eggs, neonates, fledglings, etc.—are explicitly included). Of the studies where stages may last longer than one time step, 53\% constructed the growth rate using inappropriate formulas for estimating the asymptotic population growth rate or its sensitivity to demographic parameters. These results suggest that further efforts may be required to educate biologists on the construction of MPMs, perhaps in concert with the development of new software tools. Furthermore, the conclusions of many studies that are based on MPMs may need to be re-examined, and synthetic studies using the COMADRE Database need to be accompanied by careful examination of the underlying studies.},

This is an important topic, as animals may exhibit behavior that is more complex than simple first-order Markov movement between sites, when it is necessary to devise and fit appropriate models to data. We consider the Arnason–Schwarz model for multisite capture–recapture data, which incorporates just first-order Markov movement, and also two alternative models that allow for memory, the Brownie model and the Pradel model. We use simulation to compare two alternative tests which may be undertaken to determine whether models for multisite capture–recapture data need to incorporate memory. Increasing the complexity of models runs the risk of introducing parameters that cannot be estimated, irrespective of how much data are collected, a feature which is known as parameter redundancy. Rouan et al. (JABES, 2009, pp 338–355) suggest a constraint that may be applied to overcome parameter redundancy when it is present in multisite memory models. For this case, we apply symbolic methods to derive a simpler constraint, which allows more parameters to be estimated, and give general results not limited to a particular configuration. We also consider the effect sparse data can have on parameter redundancy and recommend minimum sample sizes. Memory models for multisite capture–recapture data can be highly complex and difficult to fit to data. We emphasize the importance of a structured approach to modeling such data, by considering a priori which parameters can be estimated, which constraints are needed in order for estimation to take place, and how much data need to be collected. We also give guidance on the amount of data needed to use two alternative families of tests for whether models for multisite capture–recapture data need to incorporate memory.},

Three biologically motivated classes of prior condition are included: prior stages, linear functions of current and prior stages, and equivalence classes of prior stages. Taking advantage of the matrix formulation of the model, we show how to calculate sensitivity and elasticity of any demographic outcome. Prior condition effects are a source of inter-individual variation in vital rates, i.e., individual heterogeneity. As an example, we construct and analyze a second-order model of Lathyrus vernus, a long-lived herb. We present population growth rate, the stable population distribution, the reproductive value vector, and the elasticity of λ to changes in the second-order transition rates.

Loop analysis has been proposed (van Groenendael et al. 1994) as the appropriate method for partitioning the elasticity matrix to determine these contributions. However, in the analysis of complex demographic models it is difficult to derive the loops by simple inspection of the life-cycle graph. I show how graph theory can be used to describe a general and systematic procedure for deriving the loops from the structure of the life-cycle graph. I demonstrate that the concept of nullity (from graph theory) can be applied in this context to correctly determine the number of loops for any graph. Using examples from Campanula americana, Dipsacus sylvestris, and Caretta caretta, I illustrate the relationship of the loops to biologically relevant life-history contrasts. This relationship is crucial for the application of loop analysis to life-history evolution for the purpose of partitioning the separate effects on the population growth rate among different life-history components.},
