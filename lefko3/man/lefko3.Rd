\title{Historical and Ahistorical Population Projection Matrix Analysis}
\description{
This package creates population projection matrices for use in population 
ecological analyses. The particular specialty of the package is the construction
of historical matrices, which are 2-dimensional matrices comprising 3 time
intervals of demographic information. The package is robust and can produce 
function-based and raw matrices for both standard ahistorical (i.e. 2 time 
interval) and historical analyses.
}
\details{
The lefko package provides five categories of functions:
1. Data transformation and handling functions
2. Functions determining population characteristics from vertical data
3. Model building and selection
4. Matrix / integral projection model creation functions
5. Population dynamics analysis functions

It also includes example datasets complete with sample code.
