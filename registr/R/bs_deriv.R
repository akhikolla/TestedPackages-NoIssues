#' Nth derivative of spline basis 
#' 
#' This function gets derivative of a spline basis. Adapted from \code{bs()} function in \code{splines} package.
#'
#' @param x a numeric vector of values at which to evaluate the B-spline functions or derivatives.
#' @param knots the internal breakpoints that define the spline.
#' @param degree degree of the piecewise polynomialâ€”default is 3 for cubic splines.
#' @param Boundary.knots boundary points at which to anchor the B-spline basis. 
#' Set to [0,1] if you want this to be your domain.
#' @param derivative a positive integer value that specifies which derivative to take. Defaults to 1 for 1st derivative.
#' Value of 0 returns the original set of b-spline basis functions. 
#' @param intercept if TRUE, an intercept is included in the basis; default is TRUE
