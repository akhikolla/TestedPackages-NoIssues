\description{
Measure class used for defining measures used to compute distances between points in objects constructed with the \code{FRK} package.
}
\details{
An object of class \code{measure} contains a distance function and a variable \code{dim} with the dimensions of the Riemannian manifold over which the distance is computed.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{distance}} for computing a distance and \code{\link{distances}} for a list of implemented distance functions.
