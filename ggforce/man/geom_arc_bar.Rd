\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}} or
\code{\link[ggplot2:aes_]{aes_()}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{geom}{The geometric object to use display the data}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{n}{The number of points used to draw a full circle. The number of
points on each arc will then be calculated as n / span-of-arc}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{colour = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{sep}{The separation between arcs in pie/donut charts}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}

\item{expand}{A numeric or unit vector of length one, specifying the
expansion amount. Negative values will result in contraction instead. If the
value is given as a numeric it will be understood as a proportion of the
plot area width.}

\item{radius}{As \code{expand} but specifying the corner radius.}
}
\description{
This set of stats and geoms makes it possible to draw arcs and wedges as
known from pie and donut charts as well as more specialized plottypes such as
sunburst plots.
}
\details{
An arc bar is the thick version of an arc; that is, a circle segment
drawn as a polygon in the same way as a rectangle is a thick version of a
line. A wedge is a special case of an arc where the inner radius is 0. As
opposed to applying coord_polar to a stacked bar chart, these layers are
drawn in cartesian space, which allows for transformations not possible with
the native ggplot2 approach. Most notable of these are the option to explode
arcs and wedgets away from their center point, thus detaching it from the
main pie/donut.

\section{Aesthetics}{

geom_arc_bar understand the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in
bold):
\itemize{
\item \strong{x0}
\item \strong{y0}
\item \strong{r0}
\item \strong{r}
\item \strong{start} - when using stat_arc_bar
\item \strong{end} - when using stat_arc_bar
\item \strong{amount} - when using stat_pie
\item explode
\item color
\item fill
\item size
\item linetype
\item alpha
}
}

\section{Computed variables}{

\describe{
\item{x, y}{x and y coordinates for the polygon}

\item{x, y}{The start coordinates for the segment}
