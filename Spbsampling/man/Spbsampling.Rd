\title{Spatially balanced sampling designs}
\description{
Selection of spatially balanced samples. In particular, the implemented
sampling designs allow to select probability samples well spread over the
population of interest, in any dimension and using any distance function
(e.g. Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance). The implementation has been
done in \code{C++} through the use of \code{Rcpp} and \code{RcppArmadillo}.
