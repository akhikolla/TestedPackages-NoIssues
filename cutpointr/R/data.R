#' Suicide attempts and DSI sum scores of 532 subjects
#'
#' Various personality and clinical psychological characteristics were assessed
#' as part of an online-study preventing suicide. To identify persons at risk
#' for attempting suicide, various demographic and clinical characteristics
#' were assessed. Depressive Symptom Inventory - Suicidality Subscale
#' (DSA-SS) sum scores and past suicide attempts from 532 subjects are
#' included as a demonstration set to calculate optimal cutpoints. Two
#' additional demographic variables (age, gender) are also included to test
#' for group differences.

#' Nodal involvement and acid phosphatase levels in 53 prostate cancer patients

#' Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) emerged as the first clinically
#' useful tumor marker in the 1940s and 1950s. This data set contains the
#' serum levels of acid phosphatase of 53 patients that were confirmed to
#' have prostate cancer and whether the neighboring lymph nodes were involved.
