abstract = "We present new Monte Carlo evidence regarding the feasibility of separating causality from selection within non-experimental duration data, by means of the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE). Key findings are: (i) the NPMLE is extremely reliable, and it accurately separates the causal effects of treatment and duration dependence from sorting effects, almost regardless of the true unobserved heterogeneity distribution; (ii) the NPMLE is normally distributed, and standard errors can be computed directly from the optimally selected model; and (iii) unjustified restrictions on the heterogeneity distribution, e.g., in terms of a pre-specified number of support points, may cause substantial bias."

 abstract = {Conventional analyses of single spell duration models control for unobservables using a random effect estimator which the distribution of unobservables selected by ad hoc criteria. Both theoretical and empirical examples indicate that estimates of structural parameters obtained from conventional procedures are very sensitive to the choice of mixing distribution. Conventional procedures overparameterize duration models. We develop a consistent nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator for the distribution of unobservables and a computational strategy for implementing it. For a sample of unemployed workers our estimator produces estimates in concordance with standard search theory while conventional estimators do not.},

 abstract = {In this paper certain fundamental properties of the maximum likelihood estimator of a mixing distribution are shown to be geometric properties of the likelihood set. The existence, support size, likelihood equations, and uniqueness of the estimator are revealed to be directly related to the properties of the convex hull of the likelihood set and the support hyperplanes of that hull. It is shown using geometric techniques that the estimator exists under quite general conditions, with a support size no larger than the number of distinct observations. Analysis of the convex dual of the likelihood set leads to a dual maximization problem. A convergent algorithm is described. The defining equations for the estimator are compared with the usual parametric likelihood equations for finite mixtures. Sufficient conditions for uniqueness are given. Part II will deal with a special theory for exponential family mixtures.},
