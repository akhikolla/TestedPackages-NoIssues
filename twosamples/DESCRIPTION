Title: Fast Permutation Based Two Sample Tests
Version: 1.1.1
Author: Connor Dowd
Maintainer: Connor Dowd <cdowd@chicagobooth.edu>
Description: Fast randomization based two sample tests. 
  Testing the hypothesis that two samples come from the same distribution using randomization to create p-values. Included tests are: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kuiper, Cramer-von Mises, Anderson-Darling, Wasserstein, and DTS. The default test (two_sample) is based on the DTS test statistic, as it is the most powerful, and thus most useful to most users. 
  The DTS test statistic builds on the Wasserstein distance by using a weighting scheme like that of Anderson-Darling. See the companion paper at <arXiv:2007.01360> or <https://codowd.com/public/DTS.pdf> for details of that test statistic, and non-standard uses of the package (parallel for big N, weighted observations, one sample tests, etc). We also include the permutation scheme to make test building simple for others.
