\arguments{
\item{sampSize}{Integer: Size of the simulated data set.}

\item{nConVar}{The number of continuous variables.}

\item{nCatVar}{The number of categorical variables.}

\item{nCatLevels}{Integer: The number of categories per categorical variables. Currently must be a multiple of the number of populations specified in popProportions.}

\item{nConWithErr}{Integer: The number of continuous variables with error.}

\item{nCatWithErr}{Integer: The number of categorical variables with error.}

\item{popProportions}{A vector of scalars that sums to one. The length gives the number of populations (clusters), with values denoting the prior probability of observing a member of the corresponding population. NOTE: currently only two populations are supported.}

\item{conErrLev}{A scalar between 0.01 and 1 denoting the univariate overlap between clusters on the continuous variables specified to have error.}

\item{catErrLev}{Univariate overlap level for the categorical variables with error.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\item{trueID}{Integer vector giving population (cluster) membership of each observation}
\item{trueMus}{Mean parameters used for population (cluster) centers in the continuous variables}
\item{conVars}{The continuous variables}
\item{errVariance}{Variance parameter used for continuous error distribution}
\item{popProbsNoErr}{Multinomial probability vectors for categorical variables without measurement error}
\item{popProbsWithErr}{Multinomial probability vectors for categorical variables with measurement error}
\item{catVars}{The categorical variables}

\description{
This function simulates mixed-type data sets with a latent cluster
structure, with continuous and nominal variables.
}
\details{
This function simulates mixed-type data sets with a latent cluster
structure. Continuous variables follow a normal mixture model, and
categorical variables follow a multinomial mixture model. Overlap of the
continuous and categorical variables (i.e. how clear the cluster structure
is) can be manipulated by the user. Overlap between two clusters is the area
of the overlapping region defined by their densities (or, for categorical
variables, the summed height of overlapping segments defined by their point
masses). The default overlap level is 0.01 (i.e. almost perfect separation).
A user-specified number of continuous and categorical variables can be
specified to be "error variables" with arbitrary overlap within 0.01 and 1.00
(where 1.00 corresponds to complete overlap).
NOTE: Currently, only two populations (clusters) are supported. While exact
control of overlap between two clusters is straightforward, controlling the
overlap between the K choose 2 pairwise combinations of clusters is a more
difficult task.
