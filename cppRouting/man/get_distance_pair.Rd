\title{Compute shortest distance between origin and destination nodes.}
\usage{
get_distance_pair(Graph, from, to, algorithm = "bi", constant = 1,
  allcores = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Graph}{An object generated by makegraph(), cpp_simplify() or cpp_contract() function.}

\item{from}{A vector of one or more vertices from which distances are calculated (origin).}

\item{to}{A vector of one or more vertices (destination).}

\item{algorithm}{character. "Dijkstra" for uni-directional Dijkstra, "bi" for bi-directional Dijkstra, "A*" for A star unidirectional search or "NBA" for New bi-directional A star .Default to "Dijkstra"}

\item{constant}{numeric. Constant to maintain the heuristic function admissible in A* and NBA algorithms. 
Default to 1, when cost is expressed in the same unit than coordinates. See details}

\item{allcores}{Logical. If TRUE, all cores are used.}
}
\value{
Vector of shortest distances.
}
\description{
Compute shortest distance between origin and destination nodes.
}
\details{
If graph is not contracted, the user has the choice between : \itemize{
  \item unidirectional Dijkstra (Dijkstra) 
  \item A star (A*) : projected coordinates should be provided
  \item bidirectional Dijkstra (bi)
  \item New bi-directional A star (NBA) : projected coordinates should be provided
}

If the input graph has been contracted by cpp_contract() function, the algorithm is a modified bidirectional search.  
  
In A* and New Bidirectional A star algorithms, euclidean distance is used as heuristic function.
To understand how A star algorithm work, see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm}.
To understand the importance of constant parameter, see the package description : \url{https://github.com/vlarmet/cppRouting/blob/master/README.md}

\note{
'from' and 'to' must be the same length.
