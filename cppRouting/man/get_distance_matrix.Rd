\title{Compute all shortest distance between origin and destination nodes.}
\usage{
get_distance_matrix(Graph, from, to, algorithm = "phast",
  allcores = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Graph}{An object generated by makegraph(), cpp_simplify() or cpp_contract() function.}

\item{from}{A vector of one or more vertices from which distances are calculated (origin).}

\item{to}{A vector of one or more vertices (destination).}

\item{algorithm}{Character. Only for contracted graph, "mch" for Many to many CH, "phast" for PHAST algorithm}

\item{allcores}{Logical. If TRUE, all cores are used.}
}
\value{
Matrix of shortest distances.
}
\description{
Compute all shortest distance between origin and destination nodes.
}
\details{
If graph is not contracted, get_distance_matrix() recursively perform Dijkstra algorithm for each 'from' nodes.
If graph is contracted, the user has the choice between : \itemize{
  \item many to many contraction hierarchies (mch) : optimal for square matrix.  
  \item PHAST (phast) : outperform mch on rectangular matrix
}

#Data describing edges of the graph
