\name{which_min_nm}
\alias{which_min_nm}
\title{Return (Row, Column) Index of (First) Minimum of a Numeric Matrix}
\usage{
which_min_nm(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric matrix.}
}
\value{
Integer vector.
}
\description{
Written in C++, this function tends to run much faster than the equivalent 
(if minimum is unique) base R solution 
\code{which(x == min(x), arr.ind = TRUE)}.
}
\details{
For optimal speed, choose the version of this function that matches the 
class of your \code{x}:

\code{\link{which_min_nv}} for numeric vector. \cr
\code{\link{which_min_iv}} for integer vector. \cr
\code{\link{which_min_nm}} for numeric matrix. \cr
\code{\link{which_min_im}} for integer matrix.
}
\examples{
# which_min_nm is typically much faster than 
# which(x == min(x), arr.ind = TRUE)
x <- matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 10)
all(which(x == min(x), arr.ind = TRUE) == which_min_nm(x))
benchmark(which(x == min(x), arr.ind = TRUE), which_min_nm(x), 
          replications = 5000)

}
