\title{PIP representation}
\usage{
repr_pip(x, times = 10, return = "points")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the numeric vector (time series)}

\item{times}{the number of important points to extract (default 10)}

\item{return}{what to return? Can be important points ("points"),
places of important points in a vector ("places") or "both" (data.frame).}
}
\value{
the values based on the argument return (see above)
}
\description{
The \code{repr_pip} computes PIP (Perceptually Important Points) representation from a time series.
}
\examples{
repr_pip(rnorm(100), times = 12, return = "both")
