\title{GAM regression coefficients as representation}
\usage{
repr_gam(x, freq = NULL, xreg = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the numeric vector (time series)}

\item{freq}{the frequency of the time series. Can be vector of two frequencies (seasonalities) or just an integer of one frequency.}

\item{xreg}{the numeric vector or the data.frame with additional exogenous regressors}
}
\value{
the numeric vector of GAM regression coefficients
}
\description{
The \code{repr_gam} computes seasonal GAM regression coefficients. Additional exogenous variables can be also added.
}
\details{
This model-based representation method extracts regression coefficients from a GAM (Generalized Additive Model).
The extraction of seasonal regression coefficients is automatic.
The maximum number of seasonalities is 2 so it is possible to compute representation for double-seasonal time series.
The first set seasonality (frequency) is main, so for example if we have hourly time series (\code{freq = c(24, 24*7)}),
the number of extracted daily seasonal coefficients is 24 and the number of
weekly seasonal coefficients is 7, because the length of second seasonality representation is always freq_1 / freq_2.
The smooth function for seasonal variables is set to cubic regression spline.
There is also possibility to add another independent variables (\code{xreg}).
