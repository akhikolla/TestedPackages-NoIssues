\title{Exponential smoothing seasonal coefficients as representation}
\usage{
repr_exp(x, freq, alpha = TRUE, gamma = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the numeric vector (time series)}

\item{freq}{the frequency of the time series}

\item{alpha}{the smoothing factor (default is TRUE - automatic determination of smoothing factor), or number between 0 to 1}

\item{gamma}{the seasonal smoothing factor (default is TRUE - automatic determination of seasonal smoothing factor), or number between 0 to 1}
}
\value{
the numeric vector of seasonal coefficients
}
\description{
The \code{repr_exp} computes exponential smoothing seasonal coefficients.
}
\details{
This function extracts exponential smoothing seasonal coefficients and uses them as time series representation.
You can set smoothing factors (\code{alpha, gamma}) manually, but recommended is automatic method (set to \code{TRUE}).
The trend component is not included in computations.
}
\examples{
repr_exp(rnorm(96), freq = 24)
