\alias{repr_seas_profile}
\title{Mean seasonal profile of time series}
\usage{
repr_seas_profile(x, freq, func)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the numeric vector (time series)}

\item{freq}{the integer of the length of the season}

\item{func}{the aggregation function. Can be meanC or medianC or similar aggregation function.}
}
\value{
the numeric vector
}
\description{
The \code{repr_seas_profile} computes mean seasonal profile representation from a time series.
}
\details{
This function computes mean seasonal profile representation for a seasonal time series.
The length of representation is length of set seasonality (frequency) of a time series.
Aggregation function is arbitrary (best choice is for you maybe mean or median).

\examples{
repr_seas_profile(rnorm(48*10), 48, meanC)
