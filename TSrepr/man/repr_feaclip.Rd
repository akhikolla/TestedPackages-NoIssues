\title{FeaClip representation of time series}
\usage{
repr_feaclip(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the numeric vector (time series)}
}
\value{
the numeric vector of length 8
}
\description{
The \code{repr_feaclip} computes representation of time series based on feature extraction from bit-level (clipped) representation.
}
\details{
FeaClip is method of time series representation based on feature extraction from run lengths (RLE) of bit-level (clipped) representation.
It extracts 8 key features from clipped representation.

There are as follows: \deqn{repr   =  \{  max_1  -  max.  from  run  lengths  of  ones,}
\deqn{sum_1 -  sum  of  run  lengths  of  ones,}
\deqn{max_0  -  max.  from  run  lengths  of  zeros,}
\deqn{crossings  -  length  of  RLE  encoding  -  1,}
\deqn{f_0  -  number  of   first  zeros,}
\deqn{l_0  -  number  of  last  zeros,}
\deqn{f_1  -  number  of  first  ones,}
\deqn{l_1  -  number  of  last  ones  \}  .}
