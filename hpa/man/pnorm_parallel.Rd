\title{Calculate normal cdf in parallel}
\usage{
pnorm_parallel(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, is_parallel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of quantiles: should be numeric vector,
not just double value.}

\item{mean}{double value.}

\item{sd}{double positive value.}

\item{is_parallel}{if \code{TRUE} then multiple cores will be
used for some calculations. It usually provides speed advantage for
large enough samples (about more than 1000 observations).}
}
\description{
Calculate in parallel for each value from vector \code{x} 
distribution function of normal distribution with 
mean equal to \code{mean} and standard deviation equal to \code{sd}.
}
