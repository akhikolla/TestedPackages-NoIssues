\title{ENA Rotate by mean}
\usage{
ena.rotate.by.mean(enaset, groups)
}
\arguments{
\item{enaset}{An \code{\link{ENAset}}}

\item{groups}{A list containing two logical vectors of length \code{nrow(ENA.set$ena.data$units)},
where each vector defines whether a unit is in one of the two groups whose means
are used to determine the dimensional reduction}
}
\value{
\code{\link{ENARotationSet}}
}
\description{
Computes a dimensional reduction from a matrix of points such that
the first dimension of the projected space passes through the means of two
groups in a the original space. Subsequent dimensions of the projected space
are computed using ena.svd
}
