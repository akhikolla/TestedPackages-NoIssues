Since the html files for the tutorials (vignettes) were too large to be included with the distributed package on CRAN, we
have placed them here: [Package Tutorials](http://faculty.missouri.edu/~micheasa/sppmix/sppmix_tutorial_links.html). See also the [sppmix Package Website](http://faculty.missouri.edu/~micheasa/sppmix).
